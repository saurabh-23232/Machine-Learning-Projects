"Honest review of an edm music lover
","No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

"Unreliable earphones with high cost
","This  earphones are unreliable, i bought it before 15 days meanwhile right side ear buds got cracked automatically and it got divided in two parts, and sound quality is also not that much good but ok, one more thing bass is not good as it is a boat earphones.Guys,Also for the proof i have attached picsPlease see and think before buying​ this unreliable product.Thanks.

This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go.

"Battery life is good enough to keep going all day
","I can’t get enough of this earphone! The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better.

"Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.
","Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

"Good Earphones with good sound quality and build quality
","Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

"Good product with decent pros
","The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightBattery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangeCall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted.

"Below average product, don’t buy
","Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityCons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minLittle heavy on earsNo return possible
",Negative
"Overall good but not that worth
","he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

"Awesome bass and battery life
","Awesome bass. This is even at low volume. So if bass is your thing these are the earphones for you. Really like the sound. There could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.Great battery life as well. Lasts about 5-6 hours.The only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. I changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. Maybe just takes getting used to.Spent 999 for it on the great Indian sale. Definitely worth it.

"Review update - Product failed after a few months
","Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• The sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• Battery life is nothing to write home about – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!

"Good sound quality
","Audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.It's durable and designed right.It has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant I guess.Only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. As it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.Either way I liked the product and it does the job. Battery back is also really good.

"Amazing product. Just go for it.
","Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

"Frequent failures.
","The item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. The first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. Being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now I have registered a compliant for the third failure. The product has spent more time at the service centre than I have used it. Am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.
",Negative
"Puchase it for sub 1000 price during offers otherwise it will be too expensive for its quality.
","Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.
",Negative
"Average product
","The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

"Great earphones fir bass, MIC has no noise cancellation
","Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

"No Second Thought.....Just Go for It.........
","I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

"Good bluetooth headset if its under 1K.
","Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. However what i didn't liked is the battery backup. Its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. Overall I would say , its a good deal only if its under 1K or max 1.2K inr.. otherwise I wont recommend it.

"A good multipoint option for Rs. 999
","Got this for Rs. 999. A great deal for the price.Bought it socially for multipoint features.Works great with 2 mobiles but I have found that it keeps running into connecting issues with a Windows 10 laptop. It may take a while to connect back with a Windows 10 laptop.Battery is okay. Can't take it off the whole day.Don't expect noise cancellation. Sound is great. You can enjoy bass. Another little annoying thing apart from connecting with Windows Laptop is the crackling sound which I can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device.

"Not a great product but great for price.
","I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

"Not great sound performance but overall ok
","Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

"It is just Best among the other worsts. Just a Earphone wirthout jack. Nothing more to expect.
","It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market

I will update the review later after checking the battery backup.Edit: So, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of Tv series (40-50mins). I end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.

"One of the best budget sports Bluetooth headphones.
","The headphones are good, however the first one broke within one month, and boat replaced it, so kudos. Battery life is enough for one and half of my gym sessions, so I'd say between 5-6 hrs. Sound is clear with good depth.

"Good at it's price.
","I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

"Earphone cables are a bit lengthy that makes irritation
","In terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. Sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. Sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. The only thing that I did not liked was the length of cable. It was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. However the magnetic effect was working very fine.

"Battery issue 😤
","The bass and sound clearity is just awesome..very comfortable...call quality is also awesome...but the battery seems not ok.I got the product delivered yesterday after unboxing the product I noticed that the battery was 100% I have continuously used it for like 2-3 hours and the battery % came down to 80% again I have used it for like 2hours and the battery was still 80%.Day 2,In the morning I used it again for like 30 minutes suprisingly the battery was still 80% I was just amazed.Later I dint use it till the evening.Later on at 7 I used it continuously till 9 pm and yes the battery was still 80%.Here the real problem occurs after the my dinner I was relaxing in the balcony and was on a phone call suddenly I started getting beep sounds from my new boat 255 earphones and the I checked the battery% it was 20% I was like whaaattttt!! seriously!! Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos.

"Not good for workouts
","The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

"Good but not the best
","I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!

"Worth buying... And I liked it..
","Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.Talking about build quality, sound clarity and looksI personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge. Battery capacity could have been increased at least to 10 hrs by Boat. But no worries...

"One of the worst earphone I’ve had
","I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.

"Good Quality Sound but observed other problems
","Boat rockerz BT headphone.1. Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4. I noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. So on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on.

"Not at all Worth the cost!!
","I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!

"Honest, unbiased review. Won't recommend buying this.
","I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

"Value for money earphones, if under 1500.

Sits comfortably around the neck, earpiece is good, and feels sturdy.Noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)Sound quality - good with Android. With iPhone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. No complains on flat sound.Wires are a bit long, but you get used to it after a while.My only issue with this and other BT earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. If I keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and I have to reposition the neckband. This has happened quite a number of times.

"The “Boat” experience !!
","I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

","Great headset for music lovers. Solid bass, loud volumes and volume control separate for the headset in addition to mobile volume control which is a huge plus. Good sound quality on audio calls. Did not try while jogging, so unabl to review the moisture wicking properties much. Good length to the earphone cable and good battery life. I purchased it for 949 INR and h nice good VFM. Overall I would buy again.Design wise, I like the Boult wireless better than this as the wire tends to hang long down your neck when you are not using the earphones  Otherwise a great product to buy!

"Setting Your Expectations Right
","At Rs.1499, there are few areas that boAt delivers and largely others where it doesn't. Noise cancellation and bass are it's highlights while you might have to compromise with the poor build quality, sub-par sound clarity and battery life.With 1 week's experience and daily usage I have come to find:1. The battery doesn't support more than 3-4 hours of playtime, even at 70% volume.2. Great bass which might sometimes overshadow the mid and high tones.3. One of the earbuds has stopped working for which I have ordered a replacement and will post an update on the same.@Amazon/Appario: Excellent all-round experience from order placement to delivery to replacement initiation.

"Good but not the best!
","I bought this after searching many Bluetooth wireless earphones.Here is my review after using this product for one week with my OnePlus 6T.Pros-Battery life is good compared to other earphones.-Bass is good-Light weight even u can't feel it's around your neck-Noice cancellation is awesomeCons-Faced some issues in connectivity when mobile is in my trouser pockets(When holding mobile in hand,no issues at all)-Running with mobile in trousers also shows some interruption in hearing-Sometimes I hear unwanted noice (I think there is compatibility issues with OnePlus 6T and other devices too)-Battery charge is always showing 100% in 6T-Bass is good but I feel too noisy-The voice on connection and disconnection is weirdIf you are looking for wireless earphones under 1500,it is the best among the all! You can't get all the best features in this price range. So go for it!

"Not at all suitable for running, long run when you sweet it easily enters inside
","For the first month it was good. But from the starting i was having blue tooth connectivity issue. It was not even having good connection within 5metres. Then within 30 days due to sweating it completely stopped working. I am still searching for the right wireless ear phone which can be used for long run, marathon and resist sweating.Very poor customer care service. I returned the product and have to wait for 3 week for dispatching a new one. Still on 4th week no shipment done.

"Good bass, Value for money, Magnet feature is good
","On time delivery and product is good.. the bass wasn't feeling great initially but after changing the in-ear buds with the bigger ones provided in the packing the sound was significantly better with better bass and treble. Easily connected to my mobile phone, Smart TV, and laptop. I got it on 26th October, today is 30th.. I have not had to charge it at all so far.. i use it for a couple of hours everyday.. so battery life also seems decent.It's good value for money. Would surely recommend.

"Good sound, bad ear plug holders
","Everything is very good about this product. Great sound, I love it. However, if I I hadn't lost those ear plugs and their hooks that help u stick them in ur ear I would have given it a 5 star. They gave extra ear plugs but not those hooks that hold on to the crevices of ur ear to help u enjoy the bass. I can't find them separately on Amazon either. It would be great if Boat could include those in the package.

"A budget all-rounder by boAt
","I have been using boAt wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.This is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (Rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.Regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite Ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.Coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.Overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.The build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.Acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.One thing i dint like about boaAt is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. Given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceRegarding service center, the customers leaving in Mumbai has added advantage as i had.My previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in Goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.So customers in Mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

"Feeling bad buying this.
","Sound quality isn't that good. Not worth the cost. Durability, well it comes with a plastic construction, that you need to wear around neck. So can't fit it in anything.Feeling bad buying this product considering the image doesn't clarify the plastic ring around the neck. Oh yes one more thing Ear piece has rubber hook on it but design is so bad that you can't get it in ears properly.

"Perfect for music
","The product design is really good, comfortable, lightweight. The color combination is perfect for the unisex collection. I picked a red and black combination. The noise cancellation for the call is good but not up to the mark. The biggest drawback I felt was I could not connect to my laptop via Bluetooth plus you cannot take calls from the headset. the buttons are to control the volume and play and pause the call.

"Awesome sound quality but....
","Everything is good, sound quality is awesome, look wise also decent but.....But battery life is bad, if you consider it for using a whole day battery may end up just before your day ends. Backup of 6-7 hours is not enough for a whole day use. If you want something with good battery life jabra elite 25e is what you are looking for but something with good sound quality this is what you are looking for but if you want both this thing in one, then sorry there is no such thing available i have searched and watched each and every earphones review but this technology seems to be failing you can even see that very few wireless mouse and keyboard have good ratings.

"Good deal for the price offered
","For the price it is offered I would recommend this . Noise cancellation is surprisingly good . Sound quality is also impressive but not the greatest for sure . Bass effect is more . Fit the ear perfectly and doesn't come off . Wire and exteriors are made of plastic but serves the primary purpose . Bluetooth slightly deteriorates when you keep the phone and move to another room with too many walls obstructing . But overall is a good deal . Battery lasts upto 6 hours .

"Think twice before buying!!!
","I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.

"Low cost but high value
","One of the best boAt earphones. I have been using boAt for two years and I found their services to be very very impressive. The audio quality is very good. The music feels amazing. Bass is also good compared to other boAt products.However, one problem is that there is latency in audio while you are playing a game. I played PUBG using these earphones and there was a mismatch between audio and the action performed in the game. If you are a gaming freak and plays a lot of game such as PUBG, Asphalt, COD, or any other game where audio is everything then don't buy bluetooth devices. Go for wired one, they will perform far better. Hope you will find this review helpful!

"Conectivity dissapointing, design of earpeace flawed
","Overall:  Decent product, not worth the cost.Issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iPhone 6.Pros: Sturdy material, flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. Good battery life.Cons: The device does not have good Bluetooth connectivity. If your phone is more that one foot away from you, the sound gets cut off very often. For example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). If you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. This becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running.

Sound is quite good..bass is quite good for regular use (I mostly listen to Psychedelic, Techno and Rock, performs genuinely on all the genres)2. Lightweight - I have slept wearing it twice, never realised..!!3. Good battery life- goes on easily for 6-7 hours with one charge..(mix of usage and standby)4. Love the color- I have a red and black colour one..looks super classy..5.noise cancellation is good. Blocks out pretty much all of the ambient sound even in the middle of noisy surroundings..All in all..I am happy I waited a long time to buy a genuine wireless earphone and Boat Rockers made it worth the wait..Cheers team Boat..!!

Now a days JBL is giving bad cord for headphones... this one is good in 255.Only problem is the distance frequency is very very low.I purchased on Rs.999/- on sale.Better than other products as the round neck is not stiff so can listen while sleep too .Don't think too much just go for it .. not disappoint you .

"Awesome product!
","Very happy with the product. Been using it for last one month. Pairing in seconds. Sound quality is pretty good. I mostly use it for listening to music from Spotify/ Gaana. It comes with 3 different sizes of plug. I changed to small one which fits well in my ears. The legs are rubbery and very flexible so sits in the ear properly. Go for it!!

"Terrible sound quality.
","Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.

"Not value for money
","Didnt fit my expectations,sound quality is good but battery backup is pathetic never lasted more than half an hour on 100 % charge,moreover the range too isnt good.doesnt work for running as the fitting isnt great .packaging too was pathetic it had dust inside the package.Stopped working within two weeks,wareanty isnt smooth too,jun 14 se complaint daali hai no response.wasted my money

"The best earphones yet !
","Above expectation, excellent sound quality and the battery life is just incredible, one charge easily lasts you around mote than 5 days with normal uses (only music while traveling) and 6-8 hrs in one go if you using it continuously. The durability is nice and the magnetic feature really comes handy when not in use. Light weight very negligible weight and not noticeable when around neck, but sometimes this may result of loosing it and not suitable for bike ride (if riding at high speed).

"Just amazing audio quality
","The audio quality is just amazing!! Powerful bass and crystal clear audio. I haven't tested the battery's capacity though....but it took me around 1 hour to bring down the battery from 100% to about 85% at 70% of volume. So it seems the battery can easily last for 5 hours. Overall, it is an amazing earphone at this price range with excellent audio quality and noise cancellation.
",Positive
"Conquers the competition...
","Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.
",Positive
"Just ok product. Otherthan bass quality nothing great about
"," Bass is extremely good. No doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. Mic noise cancelation is not effective. Ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., After usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. Battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. Please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short.

"Honest Review - Average Headset
","Hi,This is a average quality headset. But in this price range I would say it is a good buy for sure.Pros:1. Very good battery backup. Last 6-7 hours on a average use.2. Build quality is good. Fit perfectly to the ears.3. Connects two device at a time. Connects easily.4. Less charging time.5. Very comfortable to wear.Cons:1. Sound quality is average. Don't expect much. You have to use equaliser otherwise no use.2. Call quality is not good. It could be better3. Connectivity issue if your mobile device is far from your headaet, even while your mobile device in pocket, sometime you will observe connectivity issue.Verdict- Well if you are a great music lover and if you are looking for a headset which has great sound quality than this is not a ideal device for you. However, if you want to use this device casually on a day to day basis like join meetings or gym etc than this a most value for money deviceThanks,Sourav

"Disappointed
","Damaged Product and Packaging.Though this item was packed in another bigger carton box with air bubble cushioning and few other items, this particular item was damaged and the deal was open already.Thought, at least the product should do well, but the product failed to take charge and power up, which clearly indicated the product was a formerly returned item due to malfunction. Rather going to manufacturer warranty and repair/retirement this got resold.I've had many ear phones from BoAt and really love this brand (in the wireless category) alternating to House of Marley (in the wired category). But this one was shear disappointment.

"Not satisfied with the product
","Sound Qualitywhomever used boat 225 in-ears headphones can understand better. If you have both 225 nd rockerz 255, you can compare the sound quality at the high volume and the clarity of songs. 225 was far better in that..And the guidelines are there only for how to switch on the Bluetooth and not clear for how to switch it off.DistanceIt was surely dislike for any one, if your mobile was in the next room then it was disconnecting again.ChargingDraining fast for continues usage, need to charge it more times. And it was not showing clearly indication of charging bar in mobile. Showing it rarely.Light IndicationIt was not clear at all. It is showing a mixed colours.MicWithout holding it you can't talk properly. It was a dear distance to use.And if you continuously keep them in ears it will be paining.Please never don't buy it from Appario seller. Better to buy from another seller. Even we can't return the product for lifetime..

"Price justified with some minor glitches
","The headphones are justified for the price that they are available. I am using these since 15 days now and haven't noticed any major drawback, except that the Bluetooth keeps disconnecting if you are using it while on bike. Some modulations are noticed then. Also, after connecting to a laptop if tried  to connect to the cellphone it does not auto connect. Otherwise and sound quality is good for a normal usage. Battery life is also decent around 4-5 hours of constant use.

( for  switch ON,  Switch OFF  &  Connectivity)There is a small light Indicator on the Earphone that works fine.We can charge the Earphone through adaptor or USB.CONSAs it is a Bluetooth Earphone, therefore, it works great within a certain range. Try not to go too far from your Device(Mobile  or PC )While Commuting If the volume is too high, The earphone cancels all the noise around us. This can be dangerous.Overall this product is great  .

"Read this before buying
","I read most of the review's before buying this earphones and i ended up buying this amazing boat rockerzz, the sound clearity is okayish but oh man, the bass, it's amazing and the connectivity is brilliant, i walk from one room to another without taking my phone and it works flawlessly Without any glitch.The problem in most of the bluetooth earphone is you have to press and hold the power button for almost 3 second to turn it on and the same for turning it off or shuffling between songs which is annoying.Wire postioning is good but it can be better.The battery almost lasts for about 3 days if you use it fot 2 to 3 hours a day and the ear hooks are excellent for outdoor activities with this earphone.After all with my personal experience i can tell everyone that you can but this phone bluetooth earphone if you want good sound clearity, amazing bass, a decent battery life, and comfortable to use.

"Realistic Review of these Earphones.
","To those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.I've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. And i F-u-kin love these earphones.Noise Cancellation is very good. You can't hear noises until you try to hear them.Comfortability. You can't listen for a longer period of time. It will start paining after 20 mins. These were not comfortable until i removed the wings. And i had some old eartips which i am using right now. These are more comfortable to me. And now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.Battery life is excellent. Used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.Now the Sound Quality.Mids are average. Won't miss any sound.Highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)The people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.I have used some high and mid end earphones like Sony Mdr xb55 with extra bass, Jbl T110 and Oneplus Bullets.At first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these Earphones but when i equalised it. I made it sounds like some high end earphones. And i am very happy with the purchase now.You will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. But if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. You'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.

"Good headphone in this range but sound quality not up to mark
","I have got this for rs.1419/- and for this range for the wireless headphone it is a good deal, sound is ok and comfortable to use, it did not fall from ear, as there is some locking type of thing, which holds the earpiece in it's place, nice product. It may feel this way because i used to airpod from apple.

"A good buy.. Good quality prouct
","I have been using this product since early feb and it still works like a peach. The sound quality is brilliant. Never experienced a break in the Bluetooth sync. No sound delay while watching videos and the battery life is excellent too.. I just have one complaint, well actually its faced by the people who i talk to over the phone. Whenever I use this product to talk over the phone, they always complain about too much background disturbance. It does not cancel out the background sound of others talking around you. Rather their voices gets amplified and I have to immediately stop using it. I validated this by being on the receiving end and the complains definitely is genuine. I think this is the only issue which restricts it from being the ultimate product.

Due to extreme Bass, sometimes vocals and fine instrument sounds get masked.3. At full volumes, bass is very loud which if listened for long time can cause ear and headache.But there is a solution to the problem, you can install '' Black player'', which has tones of equaliser settings.So recommend people to use it and obviously go for boat rockerz 255, as it is value for money product!!! 😃

"Definitely not for sports activity.
","In terms of sound quality, it is good. But this earphone is not for sports activity. The cable is quite heavy which will not let the earphone stick to your ear on heavy physical movement.Range is not even 5 meters. As soon as you cross thredistance you start getting interruption.Bluetooth quality is way poor that when you are walking listening music and have put your phone on your pocket, you start getting interruption.Wire is way to long. Around 2-3 inches extra, which looks weird if you are not putting it on and just kept it on neck. I have given the image. I am 5.4. The earphone is hanging 5 inches below my chest.Overall, bearable for walking, but definitely not good if you want to buy this for jogging or exercise.

"Zero noise cancellation and Connectivity issues
","After 15 days of research I ordered this product. I got the neon one. The band is flexible and lightweight. I mostly use this while I go for cycling, on the first day, I just kept my mobile in the front basket of the cycle I was not able to hear any sound from the earphone. Later I moved my phone somewhat near to me then I'm able to hear songs. This is the first thing which I didn't like. Second thing was there is no noise cancellation, very poor noise cancellation. People on the other end of the call are able to hear everything from the background. They are not able to hear my voice properly, background noise was so clear that they disconnected my call telling that they're getting headache. After this incident I immediately returned the product. Usually I don't write reviews for anything, whether it's good or bad. But if I don't write many users will buy the product unknowingly. So do not go for this product. It is not good in any way. Leave about bass and all. There's is no noise cancellation and poor connectivity issues.

The second issue I want to point out is the Bluetooth connectivity. This device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device.

Battery life is good but after using it for 9 days i felt that when the battery is 60% and suddenly it gets down to 20 so fast and recently i was at 60% and suddenly the earphones gets off. After i got replacement, the new product seems to work very nice regarding the battery life but the noise cancellation was damn bad like you can't listen to the music while driving because the noise of the wind is too loud you cant even talk.. and hence i had to return the product..

"Good price,good sound quality, Only build flaws
","Hi,Good sound quality at this price range.  I am using it just recently and has already noticed that build is not so good,  one of the biggest flaws actually. Second problem I faced is that the wire is too long,  hence lookwise it looks bit shabby and also it keeps calling from the ear.  Here again the earbuds design not so good to add it to the easily falling off from the ear. Who likes it!  Apart from this boat always provides satisfactory listening experience at cheaper rates. I would love to see it working even after one year even after so many build flaws,  after all if the product is rough and tough at affordable rates,  all this flaws can be ignored.Thanks!

"Don't get influenced by the celebrity ads
","Absolutely poor quality sound, very low volume, lousy bass. I would have even ignored the sound but for the fact that the earphones just don't fit properly. Even with all the options given. These are only suitable for walking at a leisurely pace for those who are on a very tight budget. NOT recommended for running or jogging as the earbuds will keep popping out. I  returned the originals once thinking I had a defective piece but the replacement too had the same issue. Spend a little more and buy something better.

"Not a long lasting product
","When we Purchased it in April'2019. Used it for Two months now.....initially the bluetooth convenience in connecting two phone and sound quality made us happy......... but just in two months the volume has become very low... the sound quality has deteriorated ..... so we are  not satisfied . will not suggest anyone else to go for this product.

"good while it lasted....
","Was good while it lasted.... three months down the line, one side earphones stopped working (no physical damage or misuse)... now I am trying to contact BOAT customer support for a replacement under warranty, but the support page on their website just does not load/exist...! Will update if and when I can get through to them...

"Nice product, great sound.
","I bought this product in sale, so got it in very affordable prices.my first impression towards the wireless earphones are not so good, as it comes with some constraints in which battery issue is one of the major.but after purchasing this product my perception is completely change, this earphone has a very nice battery backup, I have used this earphones since last couple of months but still I have not facing any issue for use this product. also has a very nice build and durable quality.I recommend to all who wants to buy wireless earphone in affordable price.

"Mediocre, avoid buying these.
","Headphones have servere connectivity issues  I use the Redmi note 4, the rockerz start having disturbance and voice starts breaking as soon as I keep my phone inside the pocket. Returned the product once 2nd one also had the same issue.Way of keeping them on the neck  with magnet is great.The noise cancellation is pretty good but at the same time is dangerous, it blocks out traffic noise totally.Audio is average, artificial bass dominates everything. Audio quality lacks basic details.Call quality was decent till the time there was no Bluetooth connection issues.Switched to tagg inferno, audio quality is much much better, connectivity problems are close to absent.

"Nice & clear sound; great bass and decent price!
","These are a decent pair of earphones at the given price. I have earlier used the Skullcandy and the JBL earphones and compared them, this is not a disappointment at all.The sound quality, clarity and bass are quite good. The quality of voice, when using for phone calls, is pretty nice too.The battery lasts for little more than six hours on continuous use after a single charge.I would highly recommend these earphones.

"Best in the price segment
","I am using it for quite a time now & i have to say it's the best one in this price segment. Sound Quality is outstanding with High Bass, it doesn't get wet even when i sweat a lot by running while wearing it. The noise cancellation could have been a little bit better, when on call the other person keeps telling me that background noises keeps on coming. Battery backup is awesome also, it remained on 100% even after playing videos & songs constantly for 3hrs. To sum it up, i have to say it is the best Bluetooth headset under 1500. You should really go for it.

"Good bass, best for music. Refrain making calls, intermediate battery life

"Recommend to try this product
","I've bought this product. For the music lovers it is really 👌. It has good noice cancellation and the mic works great but the only drawback is that the music doesn't stops even though the ear buds are connected with their magents inbuoit in it. Apart from it the bass, noice cancellation, mic and the battery🔋 backup everything is good and it is affordable price.

"Battery Life issue
","Using this headphones from 5-6 days and found below issues.1. Battery life is too poor, while using it shows 100% battery but while using battery drained out in 15-20 minutes2. Automatically disconnection of headphone while connected with phone.3. Ears are paining while using the headphones 1 hour or so.4. Battery discharge very quickly.5. While plugin to charge when its 0%, it started showing 100% charged in 15 minutes, that's a CRAP.I have now returned the product back to the seller and call for a replacement. So, its better to be move towards SONY, JBL or Sennheiser Headphones.

"Value for money
","I m writing this review after 1 month of usage. Product is no doubt a value for money, quality of material is decent, battery life is around 6-8 hours.

"Decent buds
","It's a good product for the price but if you are expecting to amazing sound quality then it's not for you it's a decent package but mid and lows are lacking bass is power full sound is clear backup is good and that's it!

"Honest review after 2 month continuously using
","it has  extreme bass and a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity. It has a mindblowing battery which gives 7-8 hrs music playback time . It's mic is also good & you will not be  disappointed with the voice quality. But more than putting 2 hrs it feels very uncomfortable to me bcz of its conical buds(can be removed). It's Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in looking.It's long wires really disappointed me. Its packaging is bad.Otherwise it is a very good headphone in this price segment.  I really liked it.

"Great sound amd battery.
","Great earphone in sound and built quality but not that good in range. Sound quality is great, even earphone is balanced and stays back in your neck. Battery is also good as I've never counted on timer but yes more than 6 hrs. Earphone can run whole day or single charge. Butto s are good and all functional as told.Mic is too sensitive even small pin drop in room feels like loud sound to person on other side of call.I found only range and mic sensitivity issue, even sometimes sound lags when device is in your hand or pocket.I returned it on these 2 factors only, rest are good.

"The Worst Earphones Ever
","First of all,, This review is about Boat Rockerz 255 Bluetooth earphone. Generally , I don't have the habit of writing product reviews but this s*** earphones made me review this in order to save the other consumers who are planning to buy this CRAP. In my opinion ,,Firstly , An earphone should be comfortable to wear. In this regard,, it makes you to cry in pain even after 5 minutes of usage !! Secondly , it should have a good audio Quality !! It's just okayish when it comes to sound quality, Nothing great to talk about it. Overall, Never buy this earphone even if they give it for free unless if you wanna hurt your ears with this abysmal earphones.

","I bought this product in Jan 2019, and now in May 2019 one of its earpieces has stopped working. The earphones performed well while they were working. The sound quality was good, and connection with the phone remained solid throughout. Full chsrgey took around 2-3 hours and it lasted for 6-7 hours on an average.The mic is a little weak, I had to often repeat what I said as the voice wasn't clear sometimes on the other end.I used them extensively for jogs and gym and they performed admirably, never getting out of the ear midway and the coiled around the neck pretty comfortably.Just expected them to last more than just 4 months.

"Value for money. Best sound quality at this price.
","Best deal if you are getting it under 1500. They are easy to use and sound quality is exceptionally good, which is least expected at this price. The built is such that they don't easily fit in any carry case especially not in the one which is mentioned in bought together catagory. The battery time is great but the info regarding the percentage battery left can be deceptive as displayed. One moment it displayes 60 % and next moment it's exhausted. But the backup is great . Can be listned for more than 4 hours when connected

"Bang for buck, but.....
","Got it at 900/- at a sale and it's a bang for the price. The Bluetooth connectivity is quite good and connects properly everytime. The range is around 10 metres and the sound distorts if you are in another room. The sound quality is okayish.. Neither too loud, nor too low. The disappointment is that the bass is flat. Don't know whether this defect is only on my device or for the entire range.  Battery backup is around 4-5 hours. But will drain your phone's battery really fast. It's a really good deal for the price, but it is not that great!Hit Like of this helped you.. Happy buying! ☺️

"Comfy, entry level piece
","Comfortable to wear and extremely simple to set up. Got a funky feel to the brand. I feel the sound has a higher bass tone, which can’t be adjusted. Battery life while on calls should be better. That said, this set is really growing on me and worth the price (1.8k)

It's really risky to put it in the bag or somewhere else.  Otherwise it's the best product.

"Very bad
","Bluetooth connectivity issues always i need boat company is not doing properly QA testing . All boat product is used to damaged very soon and thay dont have service centre as well on Bangalore
",Neutral
"Poor Bluetooth Range.
","If only this the Bluetooth range was little better this would have been an excellent product.I use thus headphone while running. When I kept my phone on zipped pocket on the back of my track I would often loose connectivity. I had to keep my phone either on my hand or front pocket which was quite inconvenient. I returned the first one but still same problem withbthe second one.I also wish they’d provide a case for safekeeping.
",Positive
"Disappointed
","Sound quality is good but there's lot of disturbance while playing music. Sounds like  music is buffering due to slow internet connection even though I am playing tracks which are saved in my phone. When they are saying it's has Qualcomm technology for better connectivity then I don't expect this.Another issue is battery drains too fast. If I charge fully in the morning then I need to charge in the afternoon coz it's switched off.I have given the 2 stars for the sound quality only otherwise it's not much worth.

"Worst earphone of my life
","Review after 4 months of usage.Life of this product is of 3-4 months,its not durable or reliable.One side becomes non-functional.The after service is the worst from Boat.There is no service center and there is no one to respond on callsYou may log a ticket with boat but there won't be any resolution for a month and no one will respond to your query.If you don't get frustrated with above things and are ready to pay more than 1000 bucks for this.. then God Bless U

"Excellent product, no lag must buy

","After using it for 2 weeks i felt like it's time to write a review about the product....Pros:sound quality is decentBattery life is around 5 to 5:30 hoursBass and noise cancellation are cool...so you can enjoy your music in all modes of traveling as well...Cons:So far I have found only one that is wire length is a bit more.If they can provide adjustable wire length that should be fine.
",Positive
"They sound good really good. Lag is really bad and connection is spotty. Don’t recommend it
","Connection issues is my main problem. Phone is in pocket and sound breaks up. And lag is awful in PUBG you stop walking and sound is like good second or two behind. Amazing sound quality for price. Comfortable built quality is not bad. That’s why I gave 3 stars. I am going to use it for music mainly so I am keeping it, but if you are planning to use it for gaming don’t but it. I wouldn’t recommend this. If you are using it for anything but music.

"Horrible battery life !!
","If u think of some bad product's I've got. This is one of the top ones. Got the new one which died a week after the return date passed. Sent it for repair and got the replacement after 4 weeks which worked for less than a week.  Sent it back again and got it after 4 weeks which worked a little more this time and lasted for 3-4 weeks and the battery is gone again. The battery doesn't last for more than 30 min no matter what I do. Charged it for a few mins and hours and neither made a difference

"Worth buying at this price !!
","Too good to have it in such price.. although it's too early to comment on every specs since I have bought this only 4 days back.Till now no issue found and having gr8 experience. Sound quality superb, battery still not reached to half though have listened to music more than 5 hrs til now. Only problem is you will experience little ear pain if you put on the ear bud continuously more then an hrs time.

"Bad Experience with the Service of Amazon and boAt
","After receiving the headphone it was works fine but after 4 day's it stop working one side, later on I called amazon to return the product they straightway denied the same and said you have order it from the business account and return windows is closed, it has only 3 days return window instead of 10 days in regular accounts. then I contacted manufacturer for the replacement they took the product from me in 2 days after raising the compliant but it took 20 days to get the replace product. it is very very bad. my one month product warranty gone for toss.

"Was disappointed at first few days, but now more than happy now
","writing after using it for more than 4 months.At first lil disappointed due toh connectivity issue, many times it gets disturbance I believe could be bcos of frequency overlapping. But I want to talk about today's experience I am traveling for around 8 hrs now its incredibly working awsm, no battery issues, no connectivity issues, still 60% battery remains. I think its bcos of short distance range.Earlier I used to take it everywhere hung up on my neck and it everytimes it took time to reconnect. So all in all happy with it now.

"Bass is above average.
","Sound quality is great in this price range. Built in plastuic. Looks a little fragile but does the job in Rs. 999. You need to take a little care of them. Fitting in ear is a little problem in initial days but your ears will adjust with it. Bass is above average which is rare in bluetooth earphones.
",Positive
"Insane value for money
","I have used a couple of budget wireless earphones in my life and this is by far the best one. The sound quality is just too good for the price. Noise cancellation is just average. The sound stage is definitely on the base heavy side but not too basey. There isn't much loss in sound quality when increasing the volume. On the whole this is a really good earphone and a amazing deal. I recommend this to anyone trying to but their first pair of wireless earphones.

"Bluetooth connectivity and battery backup
","Bluetooth connection stability this device connects instantly but while jogging working out or on the move sometimes there is audio delay interruption which is unpredictable sometimes. If I'm using it with the phone in front of me it's awesome but if you want to enjoy music on the move or jogging etc this device will dissappoint you.The battery% fluctuated.. It means at the time connection battery level was 50/60% after using it for 15/20 min in medium volume the battery gets down ivr response battery low and indicator goes totally red.

"Best in the category (Comparison with MI basic wireless earphones)
","I purchased two wireless earphones simultaneously, Boat RockerZ 255 and MI basic wireless earphones. After using both for a week, I found that:1. Boat RockerZ 255 is comparatively higher on bass and sound quality.2. MI has a better battery longevity.3. Boat RockerZ has a more sturdy built.4. MI is easier and much lighter to move around with.I use either as per my need.

"Sound and Mic issues
","Pro's - Packaging, easy wireless syncing with laptop/android, noise cancellation, battery.  Cons - Extremely bloated bass which makes it hard to listen to music to, poor mic which attracts complaint of poor sound quality while using phone/skype. These headphones are useful for sports/workout only.  Not for serious music listening or any use which needs use of the mic.
",Neutral
"Style not suitable for workout sessions!
","The earphone is fine. The wire is way too long which is annoying during worouts. The wire at the neck is way too thick. Seems like wearing a hairband around the neck. I do not like it for that reason. It will just keep shifting from one side to another and will distract you during workouts.Dound quality is good. However, the bluetooth range is not so good. It starts to disconnectent while moving in the gym from one side another.
",Neutral
"Sound Quality, Build, Functions
","sound quality: heavy bass, the vocals and instrumentals are a little drowned out by this. But I prefer heavy bass for workouts.build: build is pretty good and flexible.  it has a frame which goes around the neck, this can be kind of annoying when running or jumping, but i just tuck it underneath my shirt.  the eartips havent fallen out yet, they are a great fit.function: just a reminder that to change tracks u have to hold down volume up and down keys, double tapping middle button actually calls the previous person you called.

"Average sound quality, okay for the price
","I was hoping for great BASS which is not easily found in most low to medium budget headphones, but disappointed with it :-( Sound clarity is excellent, but output is so sharp & piercing that it could damage your hearing if you do NOT remember to reduce the volume by at least 2 points before plugging in! Over all, it is okay for the price but I already have an over-the-ear Bluetooth headset from boAt that I love and hence expected similar sound quality.

After this just gives 3-4 warning within 5minutes of play and it'll go off. 60% battery means, it should hold at least for 30-40 mins but it doesn't. Good in terms of bass and sound quality.

","The sound quality takes a big hit. I play have a lot that requires me to listen to audio ques, and I enjoy listening to music. Both of them were affected by the use of these. Also the ear plugs were slightly large and the rubber stiff enough to hurt my ears after continuous use

"Best budget bluetooth earphones
","It is one of the best Bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. The battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening. Since it is in-ear design, hence noise cancellation is good, however, it lacks active noise cancellation, which I am sure is not present in any product of a similar cost.Overall, it is a must buy and good to have.

"Almost fine in all aspects except fitting over neck while riding two wheelers
","I am totally satisfied with the sound quality, durability, noise cancellation mic and finally battery was awesome but as a bike rider I am not going to suggest this one as it doesn't fitting to our neck when we ride two wheeler.When we r driving the band behind the neck  is going back for air which is totally uncomfortable for user and pilon on the bike.For my Samsung galaxy MAX through this bluetooth headphones i can't use Google assistant as I not supporting for my device, I am not sure this problem is for everyone or not

"Not durable, average sound quality
","Sound quality is not so good and not so bad, I'd say average. Bass is good but not so strong with treble. But the main problem is the durability. In 3 months, battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working. This is the second time I'm having a terrible experience with BOAT earphones, earlier with a different model. I'm really starting to think if they're worth it because of this durability concerns.

"Worth for the Price
","Merits:-1. Been using it for last 2 weeks. The earphone's sound and the bass is mindblowing.2. Once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can't hear anything from outside even without playing songs.3. About the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are  using it continually.4. Sweat proof is also awesome,  Very flexible,  weightless. Demerit:-1. Ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music.

"Great earphones!
","The sound quality is fine, the bass is also okay. They are very light, so if you use them while running or working out you don't even feel them. The battery life is also good.

","Quality is not upto the mark. Instead you can just go with JBL wireless. It is just 300 rupees more than boat or you can opt for JBL wired which is just 800 bucks and way more worth than boat.

"Boat rockers 255
","Sound is very good.....but i think their is a design issue which make it not fit in ear properly.... that's why one can't experience the bass properly if not tightly pushed in. Battery life is suprb upto 6 hours and charging time 1.5 hrs. But due to metal finishing in winter it becomes very cold and hurts the ears. The summer u can think....Its a nice purchase for listening music but some  designing faults i can see that's it.

Along with this i couldn't experience any noice cancellation/reduction feature in this because during call (the people with whom i was talking), they were saying some disturbance from your side and the same I was feeling. So overall for listening music its good but for calling purpose its not a nice product to buy.Thanks

"Sound quality not remarkable but build quality excellent
","Not great sound quality. The bass is over amplified. But its a comfy fit and does an excellent job in cancelling out external noise. Some of the JBL headphones in the same range will provide you with better clarity of sound, wherein the mids are well highlighted along with the bass. But if you like fo listen to music with heavy bass, then these are definitely a better pick. Boat makes quality products for the given price.

"Sound quality same as Boat 225 Wired earphones which is amazing
","Amazing bass at that price range. Play with equalizer and you can milk the most out of this earphones. However, one small drawback with this earphones is that when the earbuds is inserted firmly, it tends to kind of air lock the ear which is necessary for Noise cancellation but not so good for your ears.
",Neutral
"Good but not happy
","The sound quality is good, stays firmly on the ear and battery life is decent. But, the turning on and off and battery low notification with voice is very annoying. The battery notification that appears on the phone jumps in large increments and is unreliable. Also this is unusable while running or riding as the audio gets distorted a bit under shaky situations which is I guess is the biggest flaw.

"Decent build quality and sound

Note that these headphones costed north of ₹9,000, while these earphones were a fraction of that price. Good job, boAt.

","Sound quality is very bad and signal reception is very low. If I keep my phone in my trousers pocket while wearing headset, it usually doesn't work. I have to keep mobile in hand to listen to a song without frequent hiccups. The performance is worst during calls, i dont understand the problem but i receive weird disturbance while someone is speaking at other end. Its very frustrating to switch back to earpiece mode and listen again

Also there's no refund policy from Boat only replacement will be given. So don't buy as I'm regretting my decision.

Those who are saying that they don't have bass are wrong i have used them and the bass is seriously pretty strong for wireless earphones in such a price range. They are not over priced as well. Moreover while talking over them the person on the other side also didn't face any difficulty hearing me. These earphones are great, I personally highly recommend these.

","Person on the other side of the phone hears a lot of surrounding noise when i use this earphone for calling...And I have confirmed this issue from many of my friends who are also using this earphone...They all are facing this issue...And it is really irritating for the person on the other side..Rest are good.. Battery is huge..12 hours max on moderate use..Sound quality is okay
",Positive
"Worst product completely
","Noice cancellation is not there. On call only background sound is hearing and not the persons voice. So much of distortion in voice to the opponent on call. And treble is more than base. Treble and base balance is not there. I brought it with full expectations to gift it but disappointed very badly. You can not make phone call if you are in outside. Worst product seriously. : (
",Negative
"Basic headset
","Sound quality is basic ... too basic. It cannot give the output that you would expect from boat. For music wit low volume is good. Cannot give output anywhere close to apple headsets

"Best wireless earphones in the market under ₹1.5k
","Bought it in sale for ₹1099. Much more worth than its price. The bass is real good and so is the battery life.. it charges too quickly and it connects fast too.. It can connect two devices simultaneously and its a great deal for such minimal price.. Also the delivery happened within one day so yeah a review from a happy customer😊

"Best at this price point!
","A compact product by boat at this cool price point, such a good product for bass lover. Fitting is good, noise cancellation is best looking at the price, bass is awesome.Cons are bit lengthy, low and mid tunes are not clear sometimes.Overall is a highly recommend product to all budget bass and music lover.

"DEFECTIVE PRODUCT
","No Battery back up even after full charging. No light indicator for full charge or no charge. It's working only if the device is connected to a charging port. No proper return policy. There is no option to replace the item with another brand, so i am forced to return it and compromise with the same brand which is no near my expectation. Go for a better brand.

"Can't talk while this is on. No noise cancellation

"Don't buy! Poor Quality Headphones
","First thing first, there is no bass at all only shrill treble. Bluetooth connectivity breaks down beyond 3 meters while it's falsely claimed that it has a range of10 meters. Absolutely no proof of them supporting bluetooth version 5 as claimed on the website . Chinese product with a lot of exaggerated claims.Last but not the least, the headphones have a very poor in ear grip and keep falling out despite the extended over the ear additional support. Changing the earbuds also doesn't help solve the problem.Returned them for them being very ordinary headpu that couldn't provide any real listening pleasure.

Good quality of earbuds that fits perfect in ear and wont hurt for continuos use.cons1. connectivity is wont last longer tha 2.5 mtrs.2. fits slight loose over ear, if you have small ears like i have.Note:havent checked the water resistivity yet.

In half n hour it came down from 50% to 20% and at 20% started saying that the battery is down and within one minute the the headphones got switched off which is extremely poor performance by the battery moreover the only indicator is when the battery is charging that from red colour it turns into blue colour but it does not auto cut off which is why you never know when it is fully charged or not....... Now waiting for after sales services since it has a 1 year warranty will have to see what and how fast is the services after sales...... Will update once any update comes from the manufacturer

"All the way does not meet expectation
","Ear piece is too heavy. Not comfort to ear, so it fells down easily. Sound bass is very low. It does  ot meet expectation compare to its price. So i'll not buy again from the same company. I'm surprise how other buyer can give 5*. My big faults is that, I bought this product from viewing, comparing and making decision to buy this. I am very worried about my wrong decision.

","Most of the I use wired earphones , but given there are situations in which a wire does get in the way 'such as when working outside' and it results in me accidently ripping , them out of my ears.Hence I decided I should try out these wireless and see what all the praise was about, So I did my research and decided on these, so Here is a pro's and con's list for any shoppers considering this item:Pro's:-It Comes with plenty of extra ear pieces.-Battery lasts a long time.-It includes good packaging too.-Wire around back of neck prevents earbuds from falling to ground.-The magnet holds earbuds together when not in use.-Sound quality is actually quite good.-The contols are good and the buttons feel tactile too.-Useful buttons for performing certain tasks.-Noise canceling.-Sweat Proof.-Quite inexpensive.Cons's:-You have to charge it ""this is obvious but it still a negative when compared to wired versions""After these I have tried many other wireless earphones and they have changed my mind on going wireless, Very good product overall

"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product
","This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China, like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen, you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price, this would have been a 5 star product. But, at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So, why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies,2. I am lazy,3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall, I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

Well...that's not a big issue...will soon find a way out ..I hope so... overall....these are worth...go for it.

"Great Headphones!
","Purchased these headphones from Amazon and were timely delivered. I've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -PROS :1. Sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. Given these are not in-the-ear headphones, I still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. But I really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. Battery is ok I guess, these are my first Bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. Once fully charged I can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.CONS:Only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. Other than that can't think of other points.*Regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

"Not at all worth the money....
","I purchased this product in Oct 2018. But started using this only after November 2018.It lasted hardly 2 months. By 5th January 2019, the following happened:+ The right earbud stopped working.+ The volume automatically started going down, even though the volume was set to max in the device (my phone) and this bluetooth device+ Often started to disconnect frequently - It was like it was having a mind of its own+ I successfully connected with two devices. But almost always one of them gets automatically disconnected after 3-4 hours. We need to re-connect this manually+ Noise cancellation is not there. So, if I talk in a crowded place, the other party will not be able to hear me clearly as there would be disturbance along with my voice tooMy suggestion: For the amount of money spent, this is definitely not worth. Please try out something else other than this. This product is only for people who have money to burn without expecting any returns.

"Excellent BT for travelers
","Sound quality is awesome, I am a frequent traveller of train & bike, I love active noise cancelation, no interruption of BT connection & battery life great. Comfy piece, yes It takes 2 3 days to get comfy with ear piece as it is heavy & big but one can get familiar with it very soon. Only draw point is earpiece cable robustness. Very thin & breakable cable used for both ear piece. It may get broken on very slight pull. Please be careful. Else excellent.

"Must buy if u need Bluetooth n u r audiophile who prefers balance sound
","I don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. I'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as Bluetooth codec goes for non Samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for Samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . But still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the Sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. Battery life is good too I use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy I got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. The mic is good too the person on the other end literally though I'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. Not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. Noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work

"A must have For Calling N never have4music
","Ossam looks, sturdy design, light weight. Not recommended For music lovers as sound is too metallic N poor bass (unless You forcefully push it in ur canal N align it at a certain angle which may b painful after prolonged use)  But a must have For calling. Connects 2 devices at a timeHowever after a few weeks use, I found That battery indicator is total waste. It may Show 100% once then suddenly drop yo 55% N then Keep steady at 55% N suddenly 0. So that's one thing samsung can improve in nxt update

Croma / Reliance digital / Samsung showrooms are the only official sellers of this product.

"Best in its segment!
","I have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. This is one of the best purchase that I have ever done in the audio segment. It has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. It really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. With the use of Samsung Level App, one can customize options like Vibration, app alerts, call alerts, battery level, etc. If you are using Samsung mobile which is higher than S7(Unsure if it works for models prior to S7), it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. In my opinion, this has been the bluetooth audio device type that I have been looking to buy and I am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. I would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.

Below is my review after using it for a couple of days:**Fit/ErgonomicsI really love these earpods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.These are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.Since I got these I just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.Rating: 9/10**Built QualityBeing a JBL product I had no doubts that the build quality would be top notch.The cables are solid but the buttons are a bit squishy. I personally prefer clicky tactile buttons.Since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wires which are around your ears which I imagine would prolong the life of these earphones.Please note that the center button is to turn off/on and put the earphones on pairing mode.The other two buttons are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for a second or two to skip tracks.Rating: 7/10**SoundTo explain this better I’ll compare this with my previous earphones - Boat Bassheads which is fairly common.Now, the Boat earphones are the ""in-ear"" type and these usually provide better bass since they have a better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when I used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking.I had enabled my phone's equalizer and used other software mods (Viper) to improve the sound but still the bass sounded ""hollow"" like a deep snare drum.The JBL Tune 205BT is a thousand times better in the bass department as I found it to be really deep and it has that thump (because of the 12.5mm drivers).I'm really impressed that these earpods sound better than in-ear earphones and are better than Apple’s earpods too. I also used previously a couple of Philips’ earpods style earphones but they too had the hollow bass effect.I'm currently using the JBL Tune 205BT earphones without any equalizer as I find it to be tuned perfectly out of box. I generally listen to Hip-Hop and these JBL earphones really do it justice especially the 808 kicks.I was a bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the reviews of the wired version of these earphones online but I guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum.Rating: 9/10**Volume & Noise CancellationSince these are Bluetooth earphones the overall volume will be less than the wired ones.That being said, I found the volume to be enough and then some more.Don't expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tips but that's great for people who jog/run as you have to pay attention to cars, people shouting etc. but turning up the volume you generally don't hear outside sounds. I tend to keep mine around 70-75% volume.The sound doesn't distort at maximum volume.Rating: 7/10**Connectivity, Range & CallsThe JBL Tune 205BT earphones support Bluetooth 4.0 meaning no aptX or aptxHD codec support but that's okay because the improvements are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music (FLAC).(I have subscription to Google Play Music which plays music in 256kbps and I have no issues with the quality).Once these earphones have been paired to your phone, the next time you turn it on it connects in 1-2 seconds.I did not experience any disconnects or any lags. The range was pretty good, I leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruptions.When we talk about calls, I didn't find these earphones that good because the microphone rests on your shoulder and I'm not one of those who shouts when talking on the phone but if you have a loud voice then this might work for you.Rating: 8/10**Battery Life & Charging timeThe charging takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to charge from 0% all the way till 100% and based on my usage (which is a lot) these earphones easily last me a day.Your mileage might vary.Added bonus: You get the battery info on the status bar. I'm using OP3T on Oreo.Rating: 8/10**PriceI thought thousands of times before buying these as I never spent so much for earphones before.But in retrospect I'm glad I did buy these especially considering what you're getting in return.Rating: 10/10***ConclusionIf you're on a budget and want earpods style Bluetooth earphones then please buy this.You won't find anything similar or even close to the sound that you’re getting. I have many JBL products (2 Bluetooth speakers, 1 home theatre system) so I can vouch for the sound.If you're a Hip-Hop or an EDM head then you can buy this too as these have big drivers which won’t disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizers.If this is your first pair of Bluetooth earphones then be ready to be pleasantly surprised as these make your lives so much easier and I cannot imagine going back to wired earphones.

"Not an Ergonomic Design. Not easy to Use!
","Even though, the Sound Quality and In Ear design is good, for couple of Ergonomic reasons, I am not satisfied with the following Features in the Ear Phones:1. Skipping/Changing songs- Very difficult. need to Hold for 2 Secs to change- Which is  very difficult while you are on a  jog/fast run. Need to completely slow down and Hold the Button.2. Volume Changing Button is inside and it takes couple of seconds to locate the VOlume Button and Press. Tedious and Very much iritating.3. The Driver Set and Mic Piece is very large and and heavy and which makes the ear piece to fall off while on a run/Jog.4. There is NO option for Clipping to our sports wear to avoid a Fall off.I had faced this Troubles More number of time in first 1 hour of the usage.  I feel my Present Iphone wired Earphones are the best.Please consider this feedback and have some deign Modification.I dont have Any Feedback on the Seller. Seller Communication  and Delivery was Perfect and very much Satisfied.I have requested for the Refund for Earphone.

"Don't Buy This Product 🙅
","I'm not happy with this product. If you've use JBL earphones before, you won't get feel like JBL from this product. I've purchased this product in ""Rs 2399""💰 but made quality is not like the price. And important topic is, after every few minutes it'll automatically disconnect from device you connected if you get any call. Sometimes it unable to response when we've to power off the earphones. If you're reading this don't buy this product, go for another one otherwise order from JBL OFFICIAL SITE, you'll get low price also.

"Poor Sound quality
","I used it with OnePlus 6. The sound quality is very poor. There is no way you can increase the sound output.The built is okay. Earphones fit nicely in the ear.Also there is issue of music not playing after a call in between.Overall suggestions don't buy it. No point in purchasing when you can't hear music.

"Lives up to the name
","My first JBL earbud. Straight to point :1 Sound quality - It's pretty good, clarity and tones. No thumping bass, but you should consider that these are not high end headphones but earphones.  But you will get good bass, notes are clear. I had used apple earphones before and I consider them the best in earphone category and JBL is in par with it. And here it is wireless.2. Battery life - Is good and holding 5 hrs3. Connectivity - Very smooth and no hiccups of any sort. I am using it with iphone. P.s - Near iphone battery life, it shows earphone battery life as well. I like it !!!4. Noise cancellation - I don't know why people are rating noise cancellation for these earphones. It doesn't apply here. If you want noise cancellation earphones/headphones then you have to pay much extra bucks and buy which specifically mentions 'Noise Cancellation headphones'That's it.

"Fake product
","The product i recieved is not even original. This is really disappointing i saw the same earphones at croma which were genuine and sound quality was way better than these. Material used for this product is awful.

"Good headset if you don't mind what I've stated below
","I bought these a few days back and after a lot of thought. Here's my impression:PROS:1. Sound quality - these Bluetooth earphones are quite clear and crisp which I loved, however I find that on call and even in general the volume output is low so often you have to keep it on maximum which I don't think it's heathy at all.2. Noise cancellation - these earphones have zero noise cancellation since they are not earbud style, so if you are in noisy traffic chances are you will struggle to hear music and the caller on the line3. Bluetooth range - the range is good, you can get as far as one room away with no distortion nor disturbance which is very pleasant, I really liked that. However it struggles to stay connected should you travel any further than that. Decent range, works for me4. Built quality - the build quality is as can be expected for an earphone in the range but even then it's good, well finished and the flat cable really does help quite a bit to keep from a tangled mess!5. Battery life - with medium usage it lasted me close to 1½ days on a single charge which is not shabby.CONS:1. The design of the headset with the battery on the one side and the microphone unit on the other is very flawed because inadvertently if you are using only one earphone the battery unit pulls the microphone to the back of your head and you have to constantly adjust. It happens even when you wear both, either a neckband on the section that goes around or even a clip to tighten the wire on the back of the head would have been a good addition2. The earphones - I found that since these rest just inside the ear opening they need constant adjusting as they tend to shift as you are working or moving, plus my ears started hurting a little as some point, not to the extent of returning these or not keeping them in but I believe providing mini ear hooks would have been a good idea so that they keep the earphones snug and immobile

"Good sound quality with compromise in features
","Bought this 1 month back. Very impressive sound quality and reasonable bass and noise cancellation as well. But lacking few important features. 1) No multipoint connection. You can pair to only one device at a time 2) No auto off (battery saving feature) when not in connection with any of your devices. It drains battery at the end of the day even if not connected! and not available to use (due to batter drain throughout the day) when you really want to use it. 3) No magnet in the backside of the earbuds. So, you need to take extra care when you hang them around your neck.I am unhappy with these drawbacks at this price because, my 1200Rs BT earbuds is having these features built in. Hence giving 3* even though I like the sound quality.
",Positive
"Before you buy this please have a look at my review.
","First of all let me tell you the cons of this productCONS:--> Ergonomically poor design, the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> Since it's not a in ear type and metallic, you can't keep the buds more than 30min, you start getting pain.--> Length of the cable is not as shown in the display images, it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> Button quality is not up to the mark. Ok ok--> Battery life is poor. It does not even last for 4 hours.--> Never expected JBL would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> Since the bud size is small I thought I could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. But as I told it's so slippery, there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. I was very disappointed with all these points.PROS:--> Sound quality is good. No complaints on that.I would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. It's up to you all.

"DOESN'T FIT MY EAR, EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE, THOUGH SOUND IS DECENT
","The earphones don't fit my ears!Within 2 hours of delivery, I called back amazon for a return. But they said return would only be done for a damaged product, so I've to ""live with it"" even if it doesn't fit my ears and I've to hold it with both my hands to keep it in place!Moreover it's extremely UNCOMFORTABLE as there is no rubber.Sound quality seems decent but unfortunately they are so loose in My ears that I'm unable to judge it well. Most of the sound goes out of my ears!The description said its metal earphones, but somehow it feels plastic, so I Don't want to fondle with it too much.Customer care said I could buy some ear clips so that they stay on my ears but I'm not able to find a correct match for it.

"Poor quality and only for listening YouTube videos.
","1. You have to be on 100% volume in the mobile to hear some good sound in earphones.2. Battery comes around 3-4hours.3. Comfortable in the ear but wire size is uneven and a big minus. It is bit large than it supposed to be.4. Sound quality is ok , not great and not very poor. I give 35 marks for sound quality.5. Device quality is bit poor, attached a pic . In that you can observe how it is after 1 month.6. Bluetooth range is also ok kind not more than 10feet. If you are in different room it is not connecting.Finally compare to level U, this stays bit low in terms of sound quality and Bluetooth range, but quality wise this is somewhat better than level U. Because my level U got broken in the middle and Bluetooth is connecting now. This earphones are idea for listening some stuff in YouTube but not recommended for music lovers.

"Microphone stopped working after 1 month

Today is 3th April, exactly from last 1 month i am searching for service center which accept headphones repairs and trying to get in touch in with JBL officials; however i am not able to due pathetic JBL after sales service. They claim they do not handle headphones nor do they revert to mails (send to customer care and service center guys).Update: After almost one month of following up with Jbl, I received brand new headphones.Happy with it. But customer service is slow to respond.

"JBL headset connectivity issue
","I am writing this review after using these headphones for 3months.Though JBL is a brand name but this headset has connectivity issue.

","Didn't like the product earbuds, they are not at all comfortable. Asked my few other friends to try it on, even they said not comfortable.

"Regular music lovers this earphone rocks
","I would have given 5 stars however, please find below my reviews.At first i was very skeptical to buy this earphone after reading mixed reviews. Since i needed a budget earphone i went and booked this. My first impression in regular usage was awesome. Sound quality and bass impressed me a lot. Definitely for regular music lovers this is the best buy and more than worth the money. I am taking away 1 star because i do lot of cardio (running) and because of music control the earphone tries to get pulled because of the weight and its really annoying. Music control is definitely big and heavy. I have tried cardio on threadmill and never tried on road. As of now batter backup is good. I will revisit this review after couple of days usage.

"Full indepth review of jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone.
","Tired of reading? Watch full indepth review videoAnd please please subscribe my channel on youtubeJust search for 'jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone review ajit Suryawanshi'So lets start review.....Used the product for 1 month and then writing the review1. Whats in the box? - in box you get micro usb to usb cable used for charging, product itself, and manuals2. Build Quality:- The build quality of earphone is really good. The cable is not braided but actually made up of high quality rubber. Product feels sturdy and premium. Hence in terms of build quality the product gets full marks.3. Comfort:- Talking about the comfort it's personal choice for me comfort is really good but some people found to be uncomfortable and doesn't fit well so i would suggest use apple earpods as a test. Earphone doesn't fell off while running or driving. One side of earphone has soft rubber hence grip in ear is good. Hence in terms of comfort i would give full marks4. Features and Functionalities:- In this area the earphone lets you down. The earphone doesn't support google assistant or siri. The earphone has three buttons. Long press middle button will turn on/off the earphones, while single press is used to play/pause music or take/end calls. Remaining two buttons are used to change volume and music track. Single press will change volume and long press will change track. The volume buttons are hard to press initially but gets soft over a time. Earphone has led indicator indicating on/off (white) connectivity (blue). It is blinking in pairing mode and stays still when connection is established. Earphone uses bluetooth V4.0 hence in terms of range it won't be an issue. You can easliy travel from one to another room.Microphone quality:- its good and gets job done.calling with these earphone will have No issues hereBattery life:- The battery life of these earphone is average i would say. It would get around 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is average in my opinion. It will suffice for 1 working day with medium usage. But on heavy usage you have to top it up. Watching videos or movies will drain battery faster.Charging time hovers around 1:30 hours to 2 hours from 0 to 100%. Earphone doesn't have any fast charging technology.Sound Quality:- Here i would say its a Bomb. It's surprisingly really really good. High are very clear mids are very well defined and base is also really good. You will love to hear all types of music. Instruments and vocals are also very clear and well defined. But yes its not for basshead as earphone are not very bassey. Base is very well balanced and doesn't affect mid and high tone. Hence in terms of sound it will surely put smile on your face.Pros:-1. Good build quality and great design2. Comfort is subjective but it's good3. Sound signature is phenomenal4. Good bluetooth rangeCon's :-1. Doesn't support Google assistant or siri2. Battery life is averageSo lastly do i recommend to purchase these earphones? Well definitely yes, an earphone is know for sound and in this it shines.So overall i would give 4/5 stars as it sounds really goodSupport by pressing help button if like the reviewAnd please subscribe to my youtube channel and please provide valuable feed in comment section. Any questions ask in comment section of youtube will be happy to answer in only minutes.

"Very good pair of in-ear bluetooth earphones with Apple like eartips
","Ordered these because of the Apple earpod like eartips, which I prefer to the normal in-ear earphones with rubber tips. They fit really well in my ears. Very comfortable to carry them around the neck. Sound quality is very good...not too high bass, but not too low as well. They are very soothing to the ears. Noise cancellation is not that good...but I'm not that bothered about that.

"Most uncomfortable HeadPhones
","One of the most uncomfortable headphones I tried.Actually, I bought this from Amazon with feeling that I can return if I didn't like the product (and I confirmed the same from one customer care executive). But, when I tried to raise return request it was denied. I told them it's uncomfortable to wear (maybe issue with my ear size), and there are no earpads using which I can wear it, but the so-called technical guy was not listening. He was just insisting that I should try the same and give us call on the last day for return (unfortunately I went out on tour during the same, so they are struck with me). Regarding product, if it fits your ear fine I think you will love this product. If you have sensitive ears, a big no for you.

"Average earphones.
","Now that I've been using the product for about a month I'll discuss the pros and cons of the earphones in a detailed way.Pros- sound quality is good. You can feel the kicks when it comes to hard hitting songs. Sound has clarity and bass and treble is well balanced.Cons- the earphones are not at all comfortable, they keep falling often and it really pains the ear for long working sessions. You cannot keep it in your ear for more than an hour or two. And regarding the sound, it gets distorted at high volume and also the bass gets lost. At mid-volume it's okay.And regarding the battery, it's really terrible. It's written that you can use it for six hours but I can hardly use it for four hours. The battery is really disturbing.The Bluetooth connectivity isn't bad but it gets distorted over a small range. Like if my phone is in the next room I can play the dock in the current room. But if your phone is in the next room you'll not be able to connect to these earphones from the current room.Overall I would say it's okay if you are just buying it for leisure but if you're buying it for jogging or other workout sessions then go for other earphones. These one's are not usable for working out. The buds will keep falling. Considering other reputed brands I'd say that these earphones are okay and not bad at this price range.

I contacted JBL and they closed this issue as its physical damage. This damage is due to the non - durability of 2500/- product only.

But this one from JBL is a fantastic product and quite good looking. You can go for it without any issues.
",Positive
"Below average
","The sound quality is very mediocre and there is absolutely no noise cancellation, the mic sends across a lot of noise. Very disappointing, to say the least.
",Negative
"Best for the price
","I wanted an comfortable Bluetooth earphones. So I chose this design, and I am happy with my decision.Good sound, not too loud nor too muddyBass is very adequateI use it mostly for callsWatching YouTubeAnd sometimes Music.Battery is somewhere around 4-5 hrs.
",Positive
"Good Product Would Recommend
","This a genuine buyer verified review. JBL ain’t paid me anything to write this guys trust me:)So about the review will tel u sweet and simple.Rating from 51) Sound Quality: 4.5 Excellent Sound as pure JBL signature and BASS is good considering not a “In-Ear” type setup. If u want good Sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) Useability: 5 out of 5 I bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like Apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) Controls: 3 out of five as Track Forward and backward are missing4) Battery’s life: 3 out of 5. Dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last Max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) Looks: 4 out of 5 Looks Great while wearing the only issue is the Blue Pairing light is Always ON which may annoy some people. But I think it looks cool. Specially on the white colour one.6) Noise Isolation: 2 out of 5 As these are Apple like shape u can’t expect Noise Isolation it’s good when u are listing alone but in High Public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to MAX to isolate noise around u.Overall Happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well Good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.

"Not suitable for running. Poor sound
","Can't believe this is a JBL product. Not suitable for running due to the charging port and volume blocks being heavy causing the wire to bounce around while running and eventually pull the earphones off. Terrible!!Sound quality is also very average.Boat, Phillips are definitely better. Spent a lot of money on this and now no return option.
",Neutral
"OK OK Product #WORST MIC
","Build quality is not satisfactory would've been better, battery is good enough though the sound quality is good need some improvements, for song changing you need deep press +/- button for at least 2-3secs, the worst thing is the mic though you adjust the position of it for several times whether your sitting, standing, walking, traveling and especially driving it is just shit, while your in a call it'll capture all the nonsense from the background clearly rather than your voice which is coming from just 1cm away. I think it has noise installation not cancellation. Overall it is OK, except the mic and noise cancellation.Noise installation: 5 🌟Noise cancellation: -5 🌟Mic : -1 🌟Sound : 4 🌟Bass: 4 🌟Battery🔋: 4🌟Build quality: 2.5🌟Charge time: 4 🌟
",Neutral
"DON'T BUY
","Sound quality is average. After a month it stopped working. They have no after sale service. They ask for the device and never send it back. Its not worth a lot of money but crooks should be taught a lesson so i will file a police complaint. I’ll neevr recommend you to buy this.
",Neutral
"Not working on imo/viber/messenger calls
","Recently i bought JBL Tune205 BT. The quality of the sound is great and comfortable to use for long usage. The earbuds are same as iPhone earphones. The reason for 3 stars is because it doesn't work with imo/viber/messenger voice calls. During the voice calls on these apps the sound comes through mobile speaker not the Bluetooth earphones, but on regular mobile calls it works perfectly fine.
",Positive
"Good Purchase
","JBL has launched an affordable bluetooth headset without compromising on the sound quality... Though a few days later, the richness of the audio has dropped and the rubber pads in the earpieces has come off... bottomline... sound quality is above average but build quality is bit on the fragile side.
",Neutral
"All that glitters... you know the rest!
","For being priced at INR 2,199 (that is how much I got it at) it clearly lacks the JBL standard. I haven't yet tested the battery life or noise cancellation but I'm not concerned about them tbh. It's the sound which prompted me to buy these earpods and I'm very disappointed with the sound quality and had they been offered at even half the price I got it at, it still wouldn't have been a good deal.
",Neutral
"Fake Duplicate Headphones
","These pair of Headphones were supplied by Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. Were far from original, They appeared to be of some cheap quality China plastic stuff forget the sound quality also the packing was cheap with no seal and stickers partly removed and replaced from the headphone, I was told they are not returnable so they placed a replacement order with a promise to deliver original product however this time it was much worse faded plastic colour forget metal also it does not have any magnetic effect as mentioned in the product description just fake and duplicate waste of time and money please do not buy until and unless it's genuine, The seller does not sell genuine stuff

"Too basic Good for music not for calling
","Accepted more from JBL.not satisfied.Good to listing music. sound quality awsome for music.but not satisfied with calling. to basic product not effective . No noise calling.you not able to call on road or traffic even while you drive bike at speed of 30km with the helmet.my main purpose to take a call when I busy with other activities.totally disappointed for calling and battery performance. I need to charge two times a day.
",Negative
"Noise cancellation is poor. Worst customer support!!
","First of all i want to convey  JBL to add to some quality in their products if they are charging such a high price for them. I want to share my honest observation and experience about my JBL BT.1. I bought this for the price of Rs. 2199/- which is quite high in comparison to other BT devices containg same features2. Noise cancellation is really poor that if i am outside somewhere the another caller is hardly able to understand the voice properly.3. I bought this device two months back from the very first day it gets disconnected from my mobile whenever any call come then i have to mannually connect it.4. Now its microphone stopped working and the worst part is  i deposited it to the JBL service center on 9th may 2019, they told me that they will take the time of 15days to replace the product even after waiting for more than 20 days i have not recieved any satisfactory answer from JBL customer support then what the hell the term warranty makes any sense.Now they told me that they don't have the same product in the stock and they also don't know when it will be in stock.I am highly disappointed from the customer service from such a highly reputed brand JBL, in my opinion this is just a ordinary BT earphones with a tag of JBL and no quality features.I request  JBL to look into the matter as soon as possible and arrange to replace my product.My service request no. is DL-E250519-25010
",Negative
"Good base,worst connectivity and battery life.
","One of the worst in so far I've used. Disconnects automatically. To connect it back I've to off and on sometimes. Totally disappointed.base is just enough. Battery life isn't that great to 3.5-4hrs on max usage. Can't use it for commute purposes. Maybe just gym or jogging. Little heavy on the weight side. So they'll drop pretty easily. Need to take care of that too. Totally dissatisfied. Returned the product. 🙏🏻
",Negative
"Love the sound quality and. Noise cancellation, but not for people with small ear opening
","Sound quality is excellent, along with the noise cancellation, battery haven't drained since the time I've bought it (I'm not a regular user) but still it's great. Looks good, only problem I faced was fitting it into my ears as the ear piece is too wide (this is the problem I faced with almost all earphones). But the sound quality overcomes and makes your forget about it. I would definitely recommend it.
",Positive
"A good product in 2k price range
","Overall a good product but the only problem is the mic doesnt pic up the voice really well, either when putting it around ur neck u have to talk on high pitch or u have to keep the mic near to ur mouth so that the voice is clear & crisp to the other person on the line.
",Positive
"Alternative to Apple Airpods
","I have been using Apple Airpods for 3 years now but after replacing multiple Airpods due to it get broke after using while.  I am a big fan of the sound quality offered by Apple it was very difficult to find a good alternative due to which I replaced over 10 headphones by big brand names. I must admit that JBL tried best to make it perfect choice Apple fans however the sound quality is not that great as my previous headset by Apple
",Positive
"good but not good
","The product is very good for listening long hours of playback,  you won't even feel that you got your earphones. The sound is good too. The fit is excellent as it has earpods fits. The only major issue is that it's not for call(even the feature is there but the quality is bad) the earphone get disconnect automatically sometimes from Bluetooth and the left earpiece stopped working after 2 months usage(i got it replaced, which btw took 25days). See I myself is a that kind of person who doesn't forget it's earphone at home bcoz I can't survive the same city without it. I keep on listening to music for hours and hours. So if you are like me better raise your budget and buy bullet wireless.
",Positive
"Good sound clarity and output
","JBL should have supplied a pair of silicone eartips. Ear buds are getting easily slipped off from ear. Good sound clarity and 12mm driver is able to produce good bass. Happy with sound quality but the company should have provided silicone tips for noise isolation and good hold of ear tips.
",Positive
"Really bad product !!
","I think worst Bluetooth headphones I have ever owned .It's totally incompatible with OnePlus cannot even speak on a call .Sound is okay nothing great .Battery life is bad I found it to give about 4 hours of useage.The way it fits into the ear is the worst of all .I don't recommend people buy this product.I'm on the verge of returning mine .

"Poor Product
","This product is just meant for music not for calls. There is lot of disturbance during the call & all the connectivity range is very poor. Not worth. My basic purpose was to take calls, but it did not served the purpose. Not a good buy.

"Painful on ears but sound quality good
","This is an attempt by JBL to make a different earpod style but ends up with an average product. The build quality is good and the sound quality is better but it's not like the apple 3.5 mm earpods. I have been using apple earpods since last 4-5 years and I know their quality of sound and bass. On the other hand this JBL has got earplugs made up of rubber and plastic and a metal finish which is rather painful for ears.

"Worst Bluetooth earphones

"Stopped working after 2 weeks, just after the replacement window closed
","Until it was working, the product was great. In fact, the other two pieces of the same item I ordered for friends are working fine, but this particular piece stopped working after 2 weeks. It simply cannot be switched on. The ten-day replacement window has closed, so it is unlikely that the seller will make a replacement. Given the fairly expensive model and a reliable brand, I am extremely disappointed with the product.

"Sounds Great

Not bad at all.Great sound, comfortable on the ears.Go buy them.
",Neutral
"Good Product

"Good Quality Headset. But Not ear bud type.
","Good product nice quality.. good sound quality. My only concern is the head set is not fitting properly in my ears as it's not a ear bud type. This is the only reason that I returned this product.

"Not so bad, but not too good product
","JBL t205bt is light weight, flexible and easy to carry. Sound quality is good. Bluetooth connects very fast. Build quality is very good. But the design of earpiece is little different from ibuds, hence ot is quite uncomfortable for ears. Bluetooth connection quality is not  good for calls. Sound cracks and breaks very often. Battery is ok for normal daily use. ( About 3 and half hours of music play with whole day connection with mobile can be expected). Biggest drawback is noise cancellation is terrible. You can not get good music in traffic or while riding.
",Negative
"Worked great for 10 days. Then totally DIED.
","For a product thats made for mobility, this pair of earphones just is absolutely NOT made for the gym. The built quality is tacky, plasticky. Earphones are large and not in-ear so they slip out often. There's no clip or fastening mechanism to keep them attached or in-ear. Worst of all, 10 days of use in profuse sweat and moisture has killed them. The bluetooth connectivity comes on and off whenever it pleases, rendering them totally useless. Not at all worth the price.
",Negative
"Read before you buy.
","I bought them from Amazon, ans they were okay, just average sounding earphones, but after a few days, Left earpiece started giving me problem such as low sound or sometimes no sound at all. I tried resetting them but nothing worked, I tried replacing them and the window got expired, I called Harman and they informed I need to send them to Delhi so they can have a look and check them, for like 2K I had to go through so much trouble. Although the delivery was on time as expected but things get worse when customer service is not good or helpful.

","Headphones are excellent and sound quality is also good, but the only problem is that it is not very comfortable in ears. You cant use it continuously for more than 2hrs otherwise your ear will start paining.I did compare it to iPhone's headphone, and the difference and the reason for pain in ears was that the buds of JBL  headphones are bigger than that of iPhone's. And that's why not at all comfortable in ears.Now my ears are paining like hell and I had to see an ENT doctor.

"These surprised me!
","I'm personally not a fan of the ear-plug type earbuds so I went for this. Initially, I was skeptical of the audio quality because these won't be able to seal into the ears as good as the plugs. However, to my surprise, their bass is comparable to some good quality in ears from the likes of Mi & Altec Lansing.Overall, I don't regret my purchase, Got these delivered next morning with amazon prime.Talking about the sound quality, sound is slightly bass heavy and suits my taste. The sound stage is colored and the highs are sometimes faded to compensate for the lows but it doesn't mean that they don't sound good. These sound fantastic!Anyone who wants to listen to EDM or Bollywood go for these. Good product from JBL.

","I don't understand why people are saying sound so low. Sound is just great. I bet you can't listen to music on full volume. Bass is good. Bt range is 15 feet . But price is high on Amazon. I got mine just for 2199 from jbl store.

"Great for Music -- Not for calls
","I purchased 2 sets of this product and been using for 1 week.Pros:Earpod style, fits nicely, no pain even after using for hours. (This is the main reason I bought)Good sound quality and BassNice build quality and looks great.Cons:No Sir/Google Now-- Very Disappointing, If I knew this, I wouldn't have bought it. I thought every earphone will have a long press google now support. Feels useless while riding bike and while walking.Very low call volume -- This is serious issue while in traffic riding bike in India.Low battery life.Not sweat proof.Poor quality audio in Skype for Business. (App shows your device is causing low call quality)
",Neutral
"Overrated
","I was planning on buying these but fortunately, an office colleague of mine bought one and I got to try it.The fitting in the ear is just OK; it is definitely not painful but pops out as you indulge in some physical activity like running.The Bluetooth connectivity also seems a bit off; the phone was in my pocket and it still gave that mushy noise sometimes.The biggest let down for me was the audio quality. The highs, lows and beats are just overhsadowed by uncontrolled bass. It feels like music being played in an empty hall. Also, the volume is also not very impressive. Definitely not worth the money.I currently use Boat earphones which I bought for Rs.500 and they are way better than these 2k ones.Better go for MiVi or Boat.
",Positive
"Sound, bass
","I was looking for simple ear phones which remain just outside ear and not like other pieces which go inside the ear and we r totally cut off from outside.Such earphones were not available online, even in some good offline stores also.But one day while surfing I found these .I immediately ordered ., bass is deep and loud as claimed , light weight.
",Neutral
"Good product to go with Bluetooth
","Bought this from jbl site and was available for 1999 Rs but black color was not available.I did lot of research on Bluetooth headphones before purchasing. Asked some of my friends already using some other company Bluetooth headset. All was having problem while calling. The other person on call hear some disturbance. Mainly I was looking for calling purpose. Following are the pros and cons according to me:Pros-no issue in call on both side. Perfect for callingBattery also seems good to me. Haven’t used for continuous day long but looks like it could hold for day long.Music sound also good. Was using iPhone headset and seems no much difference.In ear comfort also fineLook and quality wise no problemCons: no magnet but given one plastic kind of thing to hold both side wire togetherAuto turn off if not in use. For some it could be drawback and for some battery saving feature.I would suggest to purchase without any doubt.
",Positive
"Go for it if you are not into plug in ear buds !
","Bought this doubtfully during the great Indian sale. Happy with purchase. I’m against in ear plugs as I feel uncomfortable beyond a point. This ear plug replicates apple earphones and sits on the ear.  Very comfortable and sound is enough to satisfy my needs. Also use it for taking calls so far no issues. Charging time 2hrs and lasts for a day.
",Positive
"Not worth the price!
","I think JBL is just a brand name. To be honest this is good for nothing. Noise cancellation is zero, if I am on bike I dont even get which song is playing even on full volume. The bass is okay, not so appreciable as they market it the way it to be. I recently shifted from Sennheiser  brand and quite disappointed with this :-D
",Positive
"Sound quality is great but it may not be that durable.
","Before I write my review, I’d like to make clear that I DIDN’T purchase the item from the Amazon store. Regardless, I wish to write the review as I did come across one problem and would like others to consider it.I’ve had the earphones for almost about a month. I use it on a daily basis. And after first few weeks I noticed the ear-thing coming out. And I didn’t give much attention then but now it’s fully out and it’s bothersome.

","Don't buy, it sounds good but doesn't outweigh the problems.Falls from your ear if you sweat, hurts pretty bad if you wear them wrong takes some time to learn to wrar them correctly. Bass is there but isn't boomy hence watching movies isn't as fun nor listening to edms or hi hop.But other sound range is amazing, stereo surround is mind blowing hence sound quality is 4.5/5. Listen to some acoustics and bam, this will take you away on your own music studio, :P.....Bluetooth connectivity is okayish mediocre range works only with one device.Hence, as mentioned the pros doesn't justify the cons and nor the price.

Battery- depending on song, I listened music with volume varying from 50% to 90%. Well, battery lasted 7hr+. No issue there.I had mi Bluetooth headset in mind.  But warranty was 6 month for that. 1 year jbl. So went with this.So it's like vivo oppo cameras beautify camera photos,same Chinese manufacturer amplify base to sound good.  It's just unnatural.

"Great pair of earphones
","I usually don't write reviews, but I've bought two of these and haven't been disappointed.The sound quality is good, but for me, the best feature no one seems to talk about is the mic. I take a lot of calls, and though this doesn't have noise cancellation, it works very well for making calls in noisy environments. I rarely get complaints that others are not able to hear me or of traffic noise disrupting calls (a perennial problem in India). I'm able to take conference calls when travelling, which is a huge plus. The build quality is good. There is a problem that the wire connecting the audio input is weak and tends to break if not stored carefully. I've had that problem once, but Sennheiser replaced this without question. I've started storing the pair in the pouch they supply and have not had issues later.The pouch really keeps things secure. A couple of days ago, I forgot to take it out of my shirt before putting it into the washing machine. I later realized this and picked it from the shirt pocket after the washing cycle, dried the pair and found that it worked as usual - a huge relief.I'm not a huge audiophile and don't wax eloquent on basss/treble reproduction and the like, but for me, this is a great pair for my use cases - good music playback, great service and ability to make calls on the street. I find very few reviews focussing on these, so wanted to highlight these for prospective buyers.

"Excellent product but cable quality could be better,
","I have used wide ranges of earphones over years, some brands being Skullcandy (Smokin Buds 2), JBL (T 210), Sennheiser (HD 180, HD 210, CX 271, CX400 II Precision, CX 185 Street II, and now CX 275 S) Fiio (f1), Koss (Porta Pro) Audio Technica (ATHCOR150RD),First off there is a large difference between CX 185 Street II and CX 275 S don't even compare, CX 185 has too much of treble with very low bass, CX 275 S is very well balanced, CX 275 S reminds me of my CX 271 which I used for 7 years, its wire was of great quality and tangle free, I would have easily paid an extra 1k for that kind of cable,To anyone looking to buy earphones, go for Audio Technica>JBL if your budget is below 1k and Sennheiser CX 275 S if you just need the best audio output, and regarding other earphones I've used JBL has decent output, and regarding Fiio f1 it is just a piece of crap, it was an impulsive decision I made based just on the brand without any research, don't throw your money in garbage buying it, finally make sure you buy it from a well rated seller.

"Bang for the Buck
","Firstly I would like to appreciate Amazon.in for its amazingly fast delivery. The product reached in less than 24hrs and I opted for regular delivery.Now about the Product.I have used or still use products like Audio Technica ATH-M50X , Beats Studio, Powerbeats 2 , Jaybird X2 , Panasonic Extra Bass , Bose SoundTrue, Mi Piston3, etc .These Sennheiser earphones are firstly extremely comfortable and lightweight. They have a very loud sound output. The bass is 4/5, Treble is 4/5. The sound quality is rich and it doesn't feels like a sub 2k earphone. The earbuds are small and therefore allow a comfort fit while listening lying down or sleeping and they do not poke or irritate while listening for long hours.I purchased it for Rs 1600/- , it comes with a leather case and a L - Shaped converter which is very thoughtful .Overall i would highly recommend.

","Have been using it for over 10 days now and have been testing these beauties under extreme conditions and therefore thought of sharing my experience with this product. I will try to keep it short and to the point.Note : you get 2 years domestic warranty with the product and to check the authenticity of the product, do scan the QR code given on the box.So here we go :👉Look And FeelPremium- thats what you will feel when you hold in your hand for the first time. The material is of excellent quality and offers great durability. The earphones are slightly curved which fits in your ears very comfortably. The three button remote is of high grade rubber and feels smooth while touching.👉ConnectivityThe CX6 from Sanheiser comes with bluetooth 4.2 and connecting your phone is a butter smooth operation. I have tested it with a distance  of about 15 meters and never faced any issue.👉Battery and ChargeThe product claimed of a 6 hours long battery backup but you will get around 5 to 5 and a half hours. But the best part is it supports Quick charge and even a 5 minutes of charge can give you over 1 hour of support.👉Sound OutputThis is where the real test starts when we talk about a headphone and specially when it is at this cost. I have used BT headphones of other companies and can assure you that at this price point, its not the beat sound output but there are no competitors too. The sound is crisp and clear. The treble is just awesome, you can hear every lows and highs of it but the bass is not the best. The bass should have been a little more because thats what I like but again thats depends on person to person. But I can assure you that you will be pleased to hear the music in this headphone and even for long continuous hours.For those giving negative reviews, its adviced that you download the song at the best bitrate and then try this headphone.👉CALL QUALITYHave been using it since 10 days now and during all these days, I have tried to use it as rough as I could in all kind of noisy and louder situations but the product has never disappointed me. The sound cancellation works simply superb and the other party could hear me clearly even when I was in the noisiest condition. Never faced any issue over call quality till date. But many months to go and hoping that the brand will keep its good name as it usually does. Kudos✌️👉VERDICTSANHEISER has been understanding music and sound since 70 years and one thing can be assured that you wont be disappointed with their product. If you are a Sanheiser user, there is nothing to be said about the quality but about this product, you can definitely give it a try and you wont be disappointed and for those who are planning to buy Sanheiser for the first time, reading reviews wont help you, you need to make a BUY and experience it yourself. Since I have been using this product, I can assure you that using BT headphones for longer hours will not be a pain for your ears anymore. I hope that this review has made you make an informed PURCHASE decision because overall you would be spending your hard earned money. Thanks for reading and Happy Shopping !!

"Best for the buck but lacks in built quality!
","Pros:Really good quality sound.Perfect balance of treble and bass.Value for money.Lightweight.Good for every genre of music.Cons:Really thin wire seems fragile I fear I might accidentally rip them with simple pull.Three button pad is big compared to the thin wire, it just looks ugly in my opinion.sometimes i hear distortion when i listen to hip hop.I mostly listen to all genres.These give better kicks when listened to rock.More dept when listened to edm.These are definitely better than the previous pair (RHA M390U) which I've owned. Enhances the sound quality. You need to have good quality mp3 files to get most out of this earphone. Gives me studio feel even when I'm in public. Earbuds are very comfortable in my ears. I could hear instruments which I've never heard before in  songs. Definitely best earphones I've owned. Feels like there's orgy in my ears when I listen to songs with these. It's like someone's pouring sweet syrup in my ears.

"Great sounding earphones with one shortcoming
","Let me get this straight, the sound from these is amazing. The highs and mids are clear and the low bass end is great. Recommended for bass heads. Fit is comfortable and they don't fall off from the ears.Now the shortcoming, these earphones are not durable. The wire is very thin as compared to other earphones. In the unit I received, sound from the right ear piece had reduced to half after only 3 months of use. But as Sennheiser gives 2 years of warranty, they replaced the earphones without asking any questions. Right now using the replacement ones and they've been working great.

"Awesome Bluetooth Earphones
","I purchased this product during last week of October in special offer price. Totally convinced about the product and it’s an amazing and awesome product- Bluetooth enabled earphone connects 2 devices.

"Great sound, mediocre built
","Sennheiser are known for their great studio grade sound quality with a flat EQ, and this pair is no different. I really love the sound quality of these headphones, it is full with equal emphasis on the lows, mids and highs without any artificial bass boosting. You get a flat sound which makes this pair really versatile. It is great for movie watching and voice calls. The mic is great. Everyone I called using this pair said I sounded clear with no distortions. Also these come with 2 years warranty which is very nice to have.Now let's get to the cons, and as usual its the built quality. The wires are thin and made up of flimsy looking rubber. I have seen braided cables in headphones much cheaper than this. I would have loved Sennheiser to at least give some quality materials, because you have to really take care or else I feel the wires will break. Also the mic button feels cheap.Overall, this is a great pair of headphones for anyone looking for rich and clear sound. If you like bass, something from Sony would be better for you.
",Positive
"For calling not good
","Just for music listening this is Best earphone, But for attending phone call microphone is not good.During call you can clearly hear peer user voice but peer user don’t hear you clearly maximum time. Other end user hear echo of what you say, voice of people around is also captured by microphone even though they are 10-15 feets away
",Positive
"Not worth it
","I have been using cx180 since almost 4 years. Those earphones were of much better quality than the cx275s.The sound quality is OK, but the wires are too thin and feels very delicate. Apart from the quality, I had hard time authenticating the earphones from sennheiser, as the QR code on the box doesn't work anymore and the customer care services over the call & mail are Horrible. After wasting cumulatively 3 hours over the phone listening to YOUR CALL IS IMPORTANT TO US, PLEASE HOLD THE LINE  and WASTING 4 days, (including sat and sun)  I had given up all the hopes and decided to send the product back to Amazon. But still somehow I convinced myself to keep the earphones ( may be due to the Positive Amazon reviews and my experience with Cx180.I Just hope that I never get a chance to use their warranty services.
",Positive
"Ultimate experience for me
","Starting with the package, the box the earphone comes in is very beautiful.Now coming to the earphone itself.Sound quality:Bass is good and of high quality, highs and lows good and overall listening quality is enjoyable.Mic:Crystal clear mic, Works well, very less noise while calling.Comfort:Very comfortable. The earhooks on the back of the ear doesn't seem to hurt in longer usages. The overall weight of the earphones is less and hence is very comfortable

"Best class headset
","Sennheiser CX275s is a superb in the ear headset. Sound quality is awesome with clear reach bass. Carry with a synthetic pouch & a 3.5mm connector. Packaging also great. Only cons was wire too thin. Before I used cx180. After 10months used cx180 one-sided earphone was showing defects. I login a complain. I would send that product to sennheiser headquarters. Then they should send a new product to me between 10days. I want say to sennheiser you are No1 brand in the world,  so concentrate on wire quality. Then no any other brand can reach you

","The build quality of the headphones are pretty nice. The wires look very thin and fragile though. Three types of earbuds were provided. The pouch given with the headphones are very useful for carrying the headphones around. Value for money.The jack could have been angled instead of being straight to avoid getting frayed. It hasn't frayed till now though. Very few headphones come with 2 years warranty in this range so that's a plus point.The listening experience is pretty decent. The bass is well balanced. Mic and mic button function very well. The mic works well when its held close to the mouth.

"Amazing product 😍😍😍
","This is one of the best product at this price point. The sound quality is just amazing. Loved it. Treble is on point. Bass is powerful. Mids are balanced. Overall a joy to hear music in these earphones.Build quality is also very good. Using for around 6 months. No problem whatsoever.I would strongly recommend senheiser over other manufacturers.

"best sound quality,great at noise cancellation
","I have been using these headphones for over a year now and there is zero complain on it. the bass of the sound is perfect even the 4D sounds are really cool you can hear them really well. The product comes with three ear buds in different sizes so you can select the one which fits your ear properly. the noise cancellation it is awesome once plugged into your ears it cancels out the sound from out completely and it detangles easily, have a long wire, the microphones are good to communicate hence one could not ask better from earphones.

"Sennheiser disappointed with the product but delighted with the after sales support!
","I would have given 2 stars to the product has it not been for Sennheiser's after sales support.The product build quality is not great and it developed wrinkles at multiple place with normal usage. The wire length got reduced drastically after the wire twisted from several places. Even the music was not extraordinary but it was definitely decent.However, the mic and earphones were good if you compare it to other brands, just that it did not meet the high expectations one normally associates with Sennheiser. One of the earpieces stopped working 5 months after purchase. But a big THANKS to the best after sales support of Sennheiser, the product was replaced in 5 minutes with no questions asked!Kudos to Sennheiser to have such a customer friendly attitude and have such warranty policies which are actually there to help customers and not bog them down with questions and procedures.I will buy Sennheiser again despite this product being average given its cost because I am not afraid that my product might be faulty or develop a fault.Verdict - Buy this product for the decent sound with a great mic and the promise of Sennheiser. Audiophiles can look for other options!

"Sennheiser VS Sennheiser
","I recently bought a Sennheiser CX213 earphone for just Rs.699/- from flipkart ,over the years I have been buying headphones of different makes including Bose & to my pleasant surprise the no frills 213 exceeded all my expectations.The Sennheiser CX 275 S has a mic & comes with add-ons such as a nice leatherette pouch, two pairs of extra earbuds of diff sizes for better ear canal fit and a L cable adapter for Rs.1648 on Amazon but quality and performance wise CX213 is a much better product at less than half the price of  CX 275 S.So if you don't mind the absence of a mic and want to just listen to music or watch videos go for CX213 hands down. Quality of the wire in CX 213 is much better than that of the CX 275 S & longer too.

"But if Ur not a bass lover
","Less bass with more clarity. Idle for long listeners and not recommended for bass lovers. You won't stress out even after listening for hours. Am using this from past 4 years and I don't see any wear n tare on it and also because I handled it carefully

"A quality pair of earphones lacking in the durability department.
","A decent pair of earphones, and pretty damn solid for the untrained ear. It's fairly loud, and a little heavier on the bass side which at times makes the audio a little murky, but for the most part, above average at this price range. The most disappointing feature about these earphones is the quality of the materials used to make it. Nothing short of awful, it's very fragile and if not given extreme care will break. Heck even the cheap ₹300 MI earphones have better build quality than this. So, an absolute no go for rough users.I would recommend this to casual home listener's who can take care of their gear.

"Amazing earphones over the years!! No match !!
","I don’t think there is any match for these Sennheiser earphones !!! Absolutely amazing !!!I had an earlier version of these from last 5 years and just because they worn out I had to keep them aside.. I’ve had iPhone’s earpads, audio technica, Sony, Phillips, mi n few others, nothing satisfies as these do. The moment you have them in your ears, it reduces 40% of external noise(remember these are wired earphones).The sound(music, voice, movie) it just heard in your head. Not the ears..,!!

"Has offers own pros and cons...

"True review of CX 6.00BT and Sennheiser (as a brand)
","The battery life is a little low for my taste. Apart from that, CX 6.00BT are a solid pair of earphones with well built structure and housing for the drivers; they have a wide frequency spectrum with pretty flat sound signature with a little bit of coloring (boosted bass and treble frequencies). Sennheiser’s engineering is yet again proven to be the best. CX 6.00BT may not be a cheap pair of wireless earbuds, but trust the Sennheiser’s reputation and you’ll be surprised by buying these earphones how much well worth Sennheiser’s products are. Sennheiser is a German company, and Germans are known for their engineering skills, even in audio.Note: for people looking for bass heavy earphones, CX 6.00BT should not be one of your choices.
",Positive
"Value for money - Very Good, just short of excellent
","Used the earphones for over 7 hours today on a train journey, absolutely no fatigue or any kind of irritation on or in the ears, the large caps provide a snug fit and cancel out external noise to a great extent, the wires look deceptively thin, but can make out it is quality build, reason for 4* & not 5*is because the wires get tangled way too easily and frequently, which is very annoying, also not rating below 4*is purely coz of the worldwide warranty it's not going to WOW at this price range is my personal opinion, definitely more than a good product without doubt, especially comfort level (4.5)update : after 6 months of use, it's sturdy as hell! Definitely worth the money

"Best for those who want crystal clear sound in overall frequency range.
","I think sennheiser has degraded the built quality of these pair of earphones I'm saying this on behalf of my personal experience because I have been using this earphones from 2015(from croma at rs 1600) and again I bought it in dec 2018 but from Amazon at rs1585 (price in croma rs 1699 on dec.25.2018). I found the sound quality is still ok but they have degraded the built quality .

"Nothing special.
","Nothing special if only you want to use mic then go for it good if you really want to it used for for listening music then don't go for these earphones that is distort while using with equaliser or at high volume better go for XB55 or XB75 Sony earphones which i purchased one month after this one. I think I have used XB350 earphones of Sony earlier for 2 years that is why I was not satisfied but the thing is that the build quality of these Sennheiser earphones is not good and also have distortion. Go for Sony XB55 if you really want great sound blindly.Pic attached, one side sienhieser and one side Sony xb75ap.

Either it will get cut off or tangled easily, you have to be bit careful(2.5/5) for build qualityOverall  Value for money. You will get best earphone in mid range earphone.

"Total Waste
","One of the most regrettable purchases. Sound quality is absolutely horrible. Tested on various sources like 4 different phones, DAP, Headphone amps. Pathetic. Item is only replaceable and not refundable. My friends Mi Piston earphones are way better than this. Very thin and flimsy build to add to the agony.
",Negative
"Worth the Premium?
","Though on the expensive side of the earphone market,the cx-275s from Sennheiser is one of the most loved and trusted headphones in the segment.Plenty of reasons for this support namely the Amazing Sound Quality from the Earphones,the Good looks of the headphone and German Built.However,the wire is rubberised and may seem fragile to many while the 3.5mm jack connector shouldn't be handled roughly as chances are that the wire may get loose and you may get distorted sound.Overall,a good product with some great audio quality to make you enjoy your moments even more.

"Doesn't work on Nokia 8.
","Sennheiser CX225S has been on my list of earphones to try because of its earpiece design. I love that it's in-ear model and comes with a total of 3 earpieces; small medium and large. I use the small ones. They're very extremely weight and don't seem to weigh the earphones down while they're in use.The mic is pretty much what made me buy this. Quality of sound on call is very good and I majorly only use them for attending calls and watching videos on YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime. They work pretty well for the purpose.Cons:I use a Nokia 8 and these headphones give a constant buzzing noise in calls while the other person on call talks. The little connecter is even worse. Mutes my voice completely on the other side. Consider this if you use a Nokia phone.

"Thump !thump! Rocks u
","Thump is here....what can I say just buy it and feel the thump sennheiser is like Bose substitute...u won't feel to keep it back just always like to put on and have fun....writting it after 2 years of use and not a single defect wires look sleek but are damn high durable as it used to get entabgled to my bikes handle and boss it still rules over every other earphone in this price range like a thallaiva....GERMAN ENGEERING AT ITS BEST IS WHAT SENNHEISSEER RESEMBLES.
",Positive
"Long Lasting and Excellent Quality
","So I have been using the current pair of CX 275s for more than 6 months now. I use them regularly on my daily commute (of an hour) to work on my bike as well as in the office for Skype calls (which usually means nearly 4-4.5 hours out of the 9 hours at work)The Sound quality is good. However, if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at.They are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise-cancellation is quite good at this price point. The 2 year warranty that is provided, makes these the most bang for buck earphones. If ever, you face issues with the earphones as long as they are within the warranty period, replacement is quite hassle free. (Applies to the CX180 as well which I owned earlier as well)To sum it all up, if you are looking for a good pair of multi-purpose earphones for regular use you cannot go wrong with these.
",Positive
"True to it's reputation!
","CONS:I was a bit skeptical of buying the Sennheiser CX 275 due to the reactions on it's durability. I was correct on that part, the wires are too thin making the device vulnerable to wear and tear (and we are considering to buy a wire protector).PROS:Apart from that we have been blown away with the comfort while listening to media, it does not stress out your ears. Noise cancellation features are true to what they have claimed and the music streaming is the best( true to their reputation)All in all, I am satisfied with the purchase just that need to be a but careful with the product ( cannot be handled as how we really do with our usual earphones)

"Great headphones @1400
","IMPORTANT: This earphone is a quality product. Anywhere below ₹1400 it is a great buy. The value does drop below ₹1400 on sale and special occasions.DESCRIPTION:Included with the earphone is a beautiful leather pouch and differently sized earbuds.The bass is good and the audio clear.You may think it is fragile but it will surprise you.The wire is mostly tangle free.Noise cancellation is good too.

"Very Good Gift
","It is for clarity of sound. Keeping Price in mind - it could be one of the best options. Excellent for calls. Good for Music. It is quite balanced. This is not for Bass lovers at all - about right on all bands. Loudness is perfect. You will probably not need to play it full volume ever.Cable is not sturdy or strong - be careful not for rough use.Apart from that it comes with required stuff - like variable size tips - choose carefully to get Noise Cancellation.Very Light and comfortable - you will not feel it.It has everything that is a sign of great design - L - Shape Connector, Leather Bag.Given the on-the-go use case that this product is primarily for - a Good Sturdy cable is the only thing that I marked it 4 start for - otherwise - it is highly recommended.
",Positive
"Not Worth
","Definitely this is not for the base lovers. Very low base sometimes not that too. Not loud. I have to increase the audio level to 70% and higher to hear it well. Even a low range earphone can perform well compared to this. Please don't buy it. I even doubt on its originality. I used cx275 previously which was too good and this one is terrible.
",Positive
"Good one at Price 5300 in sale
","After using for a month, the  battery stands for 5 hr . Even if the battery is 30 to 40 % it keeps yelling , battery is low charging is required which is little bit annoying.Sound quality is good and even when traveling in trains it did not get much distracted / disconnected .Good piece for this pricing.But as the brand,  it little bit discourages regarding the sound quality while playing songs mainly the bass.
",Positive
"Nice earphones for the price, questionable durability
","Don't think these are suitable to working out but are pretty good for general lifestyle usage. The wire is long but is meant to only stretch upto an extent, do NOT test its durability. Sound and mic quality is pretty good, I've been using it for 2 years almost and quality is still brilliant.The silicon ending of the earphone might break but it's not noticeable, the important problem is that the earbuds fall off when you use it a lot as it becomes looser, you get a replacement back (although different sizes only) so that's good.I'd say if you're looking for cheap, good earphones with a mic, this is the one.

"All rounder
","Have been using this earphone for the past 10 days. For me, this ticks all the boxes, perfect sound quality, light weight, good fit and in ear comfort. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a daily use earphone.Only drawback is that no pouch came along this. Last year I had purchases the previous version of the sennheiser earphone and it came with a good pouch, but this one even though double the cost, did not have a carry pouch.. otherwise the product is great.

The first was 1.5 years ago and it lasted me a whole 1.5 years before dying on me.This model from Appario Retail has barely lasted me 2 months before sound is fading off and on in my right earbud. Wondering if it's an original/refurbished model. Plan to check with the Sennheiser store.

"My favourite so far
","If it falls in your budget, get it. That's all there is to it.I was restricting my budget to 900 because I have never felt the need for an expensive earphone despite my dialy use,so I kept pushing my purchase of the 275 for 3 years. Finally I decided to get it and it's great. I loved the cx 180 and this is even better. Very crisp,clear and decent noise masking. It's light,it's comfortable. It's got a mic that makes superb calls. I don't think you can beat this ,despite the premium over the JBL c100SI

"The Pursuit of Perfect Sound.
","Sennheisers are meant for the production of perfect sound. These aren't for bass listeners. These are only for high fidelity sound listeners. I am using Sennheiser since 5 years firstly CX 180, then CX 3.00, and now CX 2.00G. These have a perfect flat sound response. Has High Treble, Balanced Bass.The only issue is that they are very sensitive to humidity, sweat, and water. I had kept them in my front pocket in the humid climate in Mumbai. The one side that encountered sweat, or humidity and sounded a little low. But got replaced in the Service Center. Just be cautious while using it and prevent it from any type of water or sweat. Their service centers are only big cities in India, and getting them replaced is a tedious task. Sennheiser please note this issue that these earphones are very prone to water. I had used CX 3.00 and they did not have this problem (by the way I had put them in Washing Machine thrice) but the sound was not affected a bit and lasted more than 3 years (after which its wire got torn). So for the sound, these are perfect, but only if you prevent it from water.

"Awesome!!
","I was really confused before purchasing...as there are many reviews ..for cx275s...bt this one had better base and sound quality...also...there is volume ctrl remote...so I went for this one.And...now I feel...my gut feeling really paid well...this one is just absolutely fantastic. Balanced sound...decent treble...and bass. Base is on the heavier side. Overall audio quality is just amazing.I purchased this 5 days after getting cx180...which I didnt like ..as the treble was too piercing. Go for this one if you want some bass backed music...with balanced treble.

The wire is so thin I'm having doubts about the durability of the product .. (since it's about 1700 the product should have be gud ( should have given a breaded cable))2.Bass is not enough i think (considering the price).Overall the best earphones u can but if u can look past the thin wire and not enough bass .

"Sennheiser, sadly  this is one of your bad ones!
","The earphones are stylish and fit perfectly well in you r ears as you place them in.You don't need to press it in unlike other earphones, reducing the damage, typical in-ear earphones cause your ears.Coming to the sound quality, the high and mid frequencies can be heard very clearly. Wouldn't say 5 on 5 though. Listening to the low frequencies or the bass in other words was quite disappointing for the price you pay. Bass quality - 2 on 5.Overall you could but them for ₹1000 bucks may be. It's not worth ₹2000.It's disheartening even writing this as I'm a big fan of Sennheiser.I've used the CX180, CX275s and both were worth the buy. Amazing products by Sennheiser. But the CX 2.00 is not just not worth it but you could buy the other two that I mentioned above as they're cheaper and better I believe.
",Positive
"Excellent pair of headphones
","I like the clarity of these headphones. Noise cancellation works best if there is a good seal between your ear cavity and the head phones. However, this tends to prevent air circulation within the ear for me. I found this air tight feeling to be uncomfortable. Hence, I usually wear these headphones with some clearance so that air can flow freely into the ear cavity. However, this results in reduced noise cancellation properties. Overall, these are a good bunch of headphones!
",Positive
"Just lasts 4-5 months

(after rough use)thats y i was looking for new headset to buy, done some days in r & d about headset.but again found these headset are still the king of headset in this price range.....so bought them again now in 2018...hats off to Sennheiser...🙌🙌🙌if you have budget of 1.5k then go for these and if its under 1k then go for cx180(under 800 with same quality) without a doubt but u have to compromise with mic.dont thing just go for it...

"A quality product
","The overall sound experience is very gud. This is completely balanced for Bass and terrible. You'll experience all the details. This is been six months i am using it. The best part is few days back it was having some issue so i went to sennheiser Service center and they replaced it immediately. I am very happy for their service. I do recommend to all if anybody love music they can go ahead with product, may be you'll say the price of this product  is a bit higher than other brands but i would say quality and service of this brand is best. A big thanks to Sennheiser.
",Positive
"Worth it.
","First of all,  I love the design of the earbuds, very unique. I was using Sennheiser CX180 before this and they worked perfectly for two years no issue at all. Jst that they didnt have a mic so I got these. They are very comfortable and sound quality is great, balanced. Only the cable is too thin, looks fragile it was like that on CX180 too and nothing happened to that so i dont think it will be a problem.I ordered one and after using for a day i realized the mic wasnt working properly and the button also didnt respond sometimes, but i got it replaced and now no issue with it. :)

"Just okay. Wire too brittle
","The sound is absolutely superb for this price. No complaints. ALSO a superb faux leather pouch free with it!Cons:The plug is a straight one, instead of a 90° bent one. So it'll definitely be kinked there and prone to break.The wires are very thin and round. Feels very flimsy. I don't know how long it'll last. I'd recommend some wire protectors.The in ear plugs are just okay. Not too happy about the shape and size of it.
",Positive
"Sound quality is marvelous
","I'm writing this review after about 6 months of use.Material quality:The build quality of this product isn't on par with with some other products at this price range as the wires are thin and unbraided which often causes them to get entangled pretty easily.Durability:After 6 months there is normal wear and tear which also depends upon individual use but they are working just fine.Sound quality:The most important one for most of us,so the sound quality is what made me fall in love with these earphones.They're just perfect for my taste as the bass isn't that intense and the mids and lows are just on spot.To sum up:It's a pretty decent pair of earphones for their price with great sound and average build quality.I say go for it.Ps: if you are confused between jbl's earphones and this one,just go for these as they sound much better

"Middle of the road. Your mileage may vary.
","My Mother is pleased with these earphones. The Sennheiser bag is very sleek and presentable.Personally I found the audio to be okay-ish. The loudness is on the higher side and the bass seems to be excessive, overwhelming other sounds. It is not bad but it is lacking the signature Sennheiser balance and quality.This may be a good fit for phones that come sans a 3.5 mm jack. Audio over USB is low energy, and these loud earphones should even it out. My Mother is using this with a Le 2.

"Absolute value for money
","These are incredible Headphones. I had bought a one three years back. There is hardly any damage to the headphones. I use them for taking calls, listening to music, working out, etc and they seem to hold ground everywhere.The buds fit snugly into the ear and the headphone doesn't slip even when working out.The music quality is excellent.The bass is punchy and not super thumping. The mids and highs are balanced. I used songs like Jumbalika, Thriller, etc to test them and you can feel the different instruments distinctly.Recently I had wanted to buy new ones and found that these stand in comparison to 1More Dual Driver and Boat Nirvana Tres Headphones in most features.I'm quite satisfied with this buy.

"The best sound but delicate build
","Its best headphone with clear sound and amazing bass, although the effect of base is best while listening it in less noise. As it doesn’t have any noise isolation but still if it perfectly fit in ears the sound is least effect with considerable noise. That is, it’s great for general commute. Its mike is also great with it position and recording quality makes it best for calling.Although it’s not a deal breaker but like me do not expect much with l shaped extension adapter it only works with Samsung or some selected device. And it is also mention on its cover.Comparing it with Sony MDR series (extra bass series) Schneider headphone is way ahead in sound quality, although it depends on your taste but it like Sony MDR series have special punch to bass slightly cutting other aspects like tone quality and treble. Schneider (This model) have almost the same (or better bass) with even better quality of other sound, other than sound it’s also have superior in comfort and ergonomics.The only thing it lag is the build quality, in almost same price tag Sony MDR series are IP68 and build to last till you are bored with it. While this headphone needs to be treated like a baby and the other trade off with Schneider is lesser service centre in India.So, if you are planning for workout or training music then forget this try Schneider’s higher sports model or try Sony, Skullcandy etc. but if you are music lover looking only for premium sound quality then it’s the best in this price range.

"Best Bluetooth Earphones Under 10000
","Many audio enthusiasts have been scouting for good BT earphones, but JBL and Sony have dissapointed at the lower end. Most of the big names have been too busy amping up the battery or range. So I'll keep this about sound quality only, as the range and battery life is as good as the others. Many reviews have been too critical about the ''lack of Bass' but let me assure you that these beauties produce 90% of the sound signature of the Sennheiser 275, which is a huge compliment for a BT Earphone in this class. Since the bass is not overpowering, the mids and highs are crisp and clear  , resulting in true sound. Yes, the drums and bass guitar is nowhere as booming as on Sony XB55AP, but it is just good enough for Knopfler or Gilmour's guitar to sound true. While I love the Bose Truly Wireless buds sound (sans the audio lag!), I found this close to Bose Soundsport BT performance at half the cost.Bottomline: If you're a Sennheiser loyalist, you won't be dissapointed at this price point. They are light, don't feel much, fit right and have awesome build quality.  These are the best BT earphones I've heard under 10k.

"Excellent option at a very reasonable price
","I received my earphones today and although this review might be a little preemptive, I felt it was necessary to put in a word to address some concerns that potential buyers might have. One of the first concerns I had was if the product was fake; because a few other reviewers pointed to the same. As soon as I received the package, I went to the Sennheiser website to make sure that my product was genuine. It was, indeed. My primary concern allayed, I opened the package and I was very happy with everything. You get a 3.5mm adapter, extra ear buds, a pouch, and a manual. The earphones themselves are just fantastic, I tested them quite rigorously today and they held up very well. The bass is not extraordinary, but it's very good quite frankly speaking and unless you're an obsessive audiophile, you shouldn't be disappointed with the sound. The build quality is good, they don't feel cheap. I played a range of music, from your Bollywood numbers to trance to hip-hop to death metal to Djent even and found that the sound was quite good and enjoyable. At decent volumes, these earphones shut the world out and immerse you in the music completely. At the price, these earphones are a steal. I'll continue to use these and revise my review if they ever fall short of expectations.

"Review after two years. Great earphone but not for rough use
","prior to this earphones i have used JBLT150A, Sony MDR-EX150AP, Sennheiser CX 180  all of them were good products which lasted 2 years  except JBLT150 which i had to replace after 6 months. i tested Sennheiser CX 275 when my friend bought it and i knew which earphone would be my next daily driver. Its audio quality was great in all freq ranges whether its low, high or mid it was engineered perfectly. biggest con of the earphone is its build quality the wires are too thin and could be damaged easily for a rough user it will brake easily(for such user i would suggest to go for something with kevlar,flat or braided wires ) i consider myself a rough user i would fell asleep with my earphones on plugging it on either phone or my laptop. it finally took a tall on it. it started tearing of on joints and and other parts were it usually bend or gets tangled today its left driver stopped working due to damage on the wire. it  worked perfectly fine for 2years which is great considering its thin wires.

"Great earphones!
","Believe me guys, these are way better than Skullcandy method earbuds. I bought these because my methods worn off. I was a little skeptical about these, but after listening to just one song, I could tell the difference between my Skullcandy methods and these. The bass is good, treble is good, it just ticks all the boxes for me.Just that I could be a little cheaper. 2345/- is a bit too much for this model (because it is not the latest one). Overall, if you can buy these, surely go them.

","First things first, this is not a noise cancellation earphone. It's runner plugs keep outside sound from reaching the ear drums.

No nonsense reliable earphones that are a reliable workhorse of ear phones.

Such purchase is not good for people who are staying in Noida/Ghaziabad as they will suffer a lot after the problem arises in product.

"Good buy
","It's been just over 2 months since I purchased these headphones.. good balanced sounds, with good clarity.. even while on call. The overall pitch is higher than Bose, but the sound quality is almost the same.. Bass is not punchy, likeable. Highs, mids and lows are very well balanced, you can hear every note and instrument in the background. Can be a suitable alternative to Bose in ear wired headphones. The only place where Bose notches up is in the reproduction of overall sound, which gives a surround sound like feel.. and no doubt more clearer sounds. But this still is a good and cheaper alternative

"Worth every penny spent
","The model and the sound quality is is on par excellence. The moment i saw these headphones and plugged them in, there wasn’t any resistance in inserting them. The angled design gives a great comfort that my ears aren’t irritated anymore and I have spent hours and hours listening to songs before my ears start crying from pain caused by the structure of the buds. This for one has two variants and I wasn’t aware that one supports the android and the other iOS.The reason behind cost difference between both of them is an unknown fact on my side and hence I chose the wrong OS headset since I use Apple. That may be the downside on my part and the length of the wire is an issue which in turn gets intertwined with each other and I seriously fear that because of this I might not utilise the product’s life.Altogether put it’s a great product and if you’re looking for Android CX2.00G is your model and CX2.00i is your iOS variant. Be cautious and order accordingly, unlike me.

"Excellent audio quality and noise cancelation but left right polarity is flipped
","Ordered product on early september 2018, delivery was timely as usual. After approximately 6 months of use, here's what I observed.PROS1. Sound quality is really good. Covers frequency ranging from 10 hz. to 15,000 hz. Means, excellent bass, and remarkable treble sounds.2. The mouthpiece, or the mic, is also really good. I have found that the clarity at the other end is pretty good even when I am riding a bike @60kmph, which brings me to another point3. I occasionally listen to songs on this earphone while riding bike, and I have to tell you, noise cancelation is phenomenal.4. Another good thing I noted about this piece is that, while you are on a call and you speak on the mic, the earpiece gives you a feedback of your voice. In other words, you can hear yourself speak on the earpiece, which I found to be an interesting quirk. Reason being, in most of the noise cancelation earphones, you can't hear your voice, except for a deep rumbling on your chest (try speaking with your fingers plugging your ears)CONS1. Well, the wire noise is a bit turn off. Could have been better, but it is not too much to complain about anyway.2. Now this one really gets me. The left and right earpieces are reverse! From a brand like Sennheiser, this simply is negligence. Now, this doesn't make much of difference to someone who does not really care about where the sound is coming from, but for music lover like myself, this is a bummer. Your favorite song does not sound, well, like it should.But then, you can always switch your ears... Put left on right and right on left. That fixes everything, and there is no discomfort in your ears if you do so.But still...Anyway, a 4 star from my side. Fix the left right issue, and its a 5 star product.

"Best Value for Your Money
","Writing this review after I used it for more than 3 years. So consider reading the complete review.First the cons:1. Wire is a bit thin. But very smooth to handle.2. If not kept in a proper case, it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. None other that I know of.Pro:1. Highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. The 2 years warranty is something. If you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds, return (courier or in person) it to the Sennheiser guys. Provided it is physically undamaged, they will hand you over a new one.3. Noise cancellation is optimum. Pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. Awesome music quality. You can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. Mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. Bass could have been better. Ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. Use it for long hours, I mean really long time, still you won't find  anything uncomfortable with you ears. Can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6. Though I don't have prior experience using any big company earphone products, I had bought it after researching all the products/reviews available online. Believe me I'll again go for this if I had to buy a new one. The best in this price segment.

"Near Neutral Audio Experience.
","I am a person who commute most days, 6 hours up and down in train. So music of all geners and movies from around the world occupy most of my journey time, all these years. So to listen to music and watch movies without fatigue and noise of the train is very much important for me. To put in short, this ear phone is neutral. Sound quality of this ear phone is  very good. Those who love neutral sound (which is the best option to listen to all types of music), can very well opt for this. Sound equilibrium from high freequency to low without distortions is well maintained. (I can give u a tip to check your audio listening devices. Play ""Bohemian Rhapsody by queen. The song covers all most all freequency levels, with different vocals and instruments.)  No sickening high bass. Those who love thumping bass may opt for other ear phones.But....... This product is not worth what it costs. The same quality of Sound can be obtained from a JBL  C100SI earphone as well (Durabilty of the mentioned JBL product is below average. I couldnt even use it for one year)  but it costs only half the price of this  product. I cant say anything about durability at this moment, since i bought this just one day back only.Hoping for the best...

"Best one
","It has been more than 3 years since I bought this headphone. Iam completely satisfied with it. But one side of the headphone has stopped working now and Iam thinking of buying a new one. I have been contemplating for a while but could not think of any other product than this one. If Iam going to buy a new one, it will be the same model. For any headphone, 3 years is a good span and Iam sure that if we protect the portion near the plug from being worn out, it will definitely last much longer. Usually in any headphone , one side of it stops working because the wire near the plug portions gets worn out with time.

"Perfect sound but connecting with iPhone is a trouble
","Sound quality awesome. Fixes in ear easily. The only suggestion is if you can start making the jack for the iPhone users too. Right now I have to connect the connector separately to use the earphones which looks odd. And iPhone connectors or earphones are very delicate, and destroy pretty fast.

"Awesome Sound Quality
","I purchased this last week. Good delivery by Amazon, got it on second day.I've been trying different earphones of philips, sony, skullcandy and even steel series siberia v1(though it's built for gaming not for music) for long time to get the best earphone in my budget and now I tried this. I haven't experienced anything like this before. Excellent bass with crystal clear sound even at 10% volume and complete isolation from noise. If your phone doesn't support some of these earphones, no worries. A connector comes with the earphone for your phone.If you wanna have a new experience, try this...
",Positive
"Performance , only short lived.
","If I would have written a review in the initial days of usage of these earphones, it would have been an amazing review of the product. But after 6 months of usage, I observed a volume difference between the two ear buds. This is something that is damaging for the ear. No one would recommend using such a product. Sennheiser should really look into the product's performance in longer term(more than 6 months). If the product is not able to deliver as promised after 6 months, then it should be mentioned in the product's description.

"Awesome!!! But fragile..
","First off, great service by Amazon, received the earphones in less than 24 hours. Next, the sound quality of the earphones is phenomenal. Sennheiser, as usual, have one of the best sounds money can buy, and these are no different. Only downside is, the wire is so thin and fragile, I'm 99% sure it's not going to last the 2 years of warranty the earphones come with. Maybe a little stronger cord would do wonders. 4.8/5 stars.

"Simply the best!!!
","I normally don't write any reviews, but this masterpiece moved me to share my experience with this beast. First of all, the product is really premium in terms of sound quality, call clarity, material used, provided accessories. You can't find such a bass effect on a headphone as it looks simple but blows out the music experience. Only con is the product wears off in two years and this is my third purchase and I buy this only for the experience which no headphones had left me with. I would definitely recommend it for any music lovers and gamers.

"Internal damage within 6 months
","Bought it on May this year, now it's completely damaged from the inside even though it looks good from the outside. When the earphone is connected, it turns the volume up and down on it's own, plays or pauses the songs automatically and opens apps (especially Google assistant) on it's own. I thought it was a virus at first but after thorough scanning with different anti- viruses with no signs, I realized that it was indeed my earphone that was actually messing around with my smartphone. Also the sound quality was not worth right from the start (maybe I received a defective piece). It had more trebel and hardly any  bass. Even when I set my equaliser to bass boost, the bass quality was not that great. Infact the cx180 I had before sounded better than this.
",Negative
"Clarity is good but few issues i found.....
","Volume seems to be very poor and sound can be heard only after raising the volume at least 50%. I got it replaced with another piece but still having the same issue. Also, this headphone doesn't have that punchy bass but clarity is very good and sound is crystal clear. So if you are a bass lover then may be its not a perfect choice for you.Also, the mic is not that good and i have to keep it very near to my mouth then only the other person can hear me properly. I wanted a replacement with another brand but seems seller doesn't have that in policy.

"Really overpriced for a substandard quality earbud, that too from Sennheiser !
","I have been a audiophile from over a decade and purchased this as a replacement to a Sennheiser earbud pair that i had purchased in Amsterdam a couple of years ago. I became a fan of what i had earlier and thought Sennheiser would have improved the model as this one was priced higher, but to my great disappointment... the grip is bad, cable is really cheap quality, noise isolation - almost nil and finally audio quality, less than average... i have bought a JBL for my daughter at half this price... would not recommend.

"Average Experience- cheap wire - Not worth the price - Rating: 2.5/5
","The product quality is not that good. Wire seams to be very cheap. Even after the discount not worth the price.. Very low bass.. even low cost earphones have rich bass..  We can increase the bass by using equilizer but even though with equilizer the experience improved very slightly and also after using Equalizer the voice losses it's originality. Will not recommend it if one is hoping for rich bass with quality earphone. Used JBL C100si (wired) and boat - Rs. 1500 (Bluetooth) both were way better then this.

","Got to say, not impressed.Sound profile is wide ,and the bass is spot on. Does not overpower vocals . But yet there is something missing idk what. The stereo effect is less.I compared it with my OneMore piston fit and Boat basshead 220 . It is better than both. But I've heard a lot of sony xb55 and one of the youtuber suggested it over the 275 .Be aware cause there is no refund after you buy it . There is only replacement . So make a wise decision and buy Sony XB55 AP instead.

"No Longer the best under 2K
","The major issue with this IEM is the build quality. The wire is so thin, it's almost on the verge of being invisible. The plastic used for mid and earset doesn't give any assurance either. The sound compared to other recent earphones in the same price segment is at best passable. The bass isn't rich, the music doesn't feel lively, although vocals seems fine.The right-side earphone stopped working after a year and a half, no  doubt due the higher probability of wear and tear with this set.Skip this, and go for Byron's or SOUND magic E 11 C

"Best earphones you can buy in this price range
","First of all, I love Sennheiser. There's no one better in the game when it comes to audio equipments. Earphones are very durable. These have been in washing machine like 5-6 times now (mistakenly). But I just take them out and leave them for drying for 1-2 days and they are back to normal. Cord has been pulled numerous time. Twice, I thought no way these could survive through this much pulling force. But, I underestimated it. I got these as an upgrade from CX 180 after using them for 3 years. I recommend these.

"The Leader of wired headphones.
","Sennheiser CX 275 are the best wired headphones available. The concentration is more on the quality of midrange output rather than ear deafening bass.

The quality of sound gives you the opportunity to listen to those notes in your fav songs which you may have never been able to listen on a regular cheap bass heavy headphones.

"Placement in Ear
","When I first tried these ear buds, I did not have them far enough inside the ear and the sound was very tinty.This morning, I seemed to have placed the buds further into my ears and the quality of the sound improved 1,000 fold.The size of the rubber ear pieces is extremely important. The bass seems absent unless the buds are fully inside ear. The only downside I see is the lack of volume control and ability to switch tracks when listening to music. Hope to have provided a helpful review.

"Normal

You can take calls and end calls with the call button. It is the only single button present there. Voice quality is average and it was snubbing the voice a bit. On the main screen if you press the button, it would open the default music player and starts playing a song. If you press again, it will pause it. It is capable of capturing FM radio signals.

"Sennheiser is Love!
","Amazing sound quality, clear and punchy bass. Good mids. And treble that doesn't bleed your ears! Light to use and comfortable for prolonged use as well. Low impedance, thus low power draw and loud volume. Inline mic is good quality, for calls only tough! Comes with a carrying pouch, do use it! It is not completely tangle free, but is fine.

","Usually plug type earphones don't give much bass which is standard for all brands not matter how big or small. I, however, was pleasantly surprised by the bass. I wasn't looking forward to it much while buying since I know plugs aren't effective bass wise. It's great. I also have another  Sennheiser, same-ish specifications but they aren't plugs, and this one does a 10% better job than that.PS: I'm a Sennheiser lad so my review may be baised (or not). But they are just better than expensive Sony (bass reflex) etc that I've used in the past.

"No volume control button
","I've used Sennheiser before. This has more than decent sound quality. But the biggest turn off is that it doesn't come with volume control on wire.

"Best headset within 2000Rs. Period
","If what you want is quality sound with well differentiated mids and highs and a moderate amount of bass, Not overpowering, but the right amount for a song as such. Then get this. Not for extra bass lovers. The fit is a little bit tricky to insert as well because of the unconventional shape of the headsets. But what matters is the sound quality, The latency is almost non existent on the microphone button, atleast on my phone anyway. No microphonics at all during normal usage and during walking. This is probably the only headset where i did not rely on the music player inbuilt equaliser to modify the sound signature. That speaks about the sound reproduction on the Sennheiser headsets.

At the same time, this earphones have very good noise attenuation features really. I have got these for around ₹1513, which is a very good deal and they are worth the bucks I have shelled out.

"Great fit
","Wow! Just wow. Haven’t used any earphones that fit in my ears better than these ones. Sound good, everything good. For me, the fit has been the biggest challenge always and these win hands down.

"Its an average built headphone.
","In the name of noise cancellation it it just a freek. It just fits good in ears doesn't cansel noise. Wire should have been made of better quality to avoid tangelling. In the price range that it is being sold.

"Sennheiser service is great..
","Sennheiser service is great....I bought this product in July 2016 but unfortunately, it got damaged due to a manufacturing defect. I contacted customer service through the toll-free number. They said to courier the product with the bill to Bangalore as it the only nearest service center to me (Chennai). I couriered it as they informed and within 5 days I got a new Sennheiser CX 275 S. THANKS, alot Sennheiser.

"I cannot afford a Bose but this thing is definitely way better than my native Samsung/Nokia headsets
","Noise reduction ?---------- A BIG YES. @ 1300 bucks in 'Amazon lightning deals' which would otherwise be 2000 bucks at any other website, it was definitely a steal. 100% loud applause for Amazon for making this real.Product:- Thumping basses + sizzling trebles.....nothing much out of proportion or distorted. I am not a technical buff nor have I done any course in musicology but I have had at least a dozen headsets from various makers in the past  and can assure that this thing is a beast. Again, don't always blame the hardware. The same song at 96 kbps and 320 kbps sound different through the same gadget. I cannot afford a Bose but this thing is definitely way better than my native Samsung/Nokia headsets.

"Simply, The BEST!
","I have been using this for almost 2 years now. I have tried so many earphones on the last 10 years.... But none come even close to the quality you get with this one. Exceptional clarity and superb responsive in both low and high frequencies.Each time you put it on, you can feel the difference.
",Positive
"Worth it!
","Overall pretty good.Complete noise cancellation is not expected at this price range anyway. But it does reduce some background noise.Earbubs fit quite well. Would not fall off during workout. Build quality is also very nice.Sound quality is very good at this price range although it lacks the punchy bass that some prefer.

"Amazing  and balanced Sound
","As usual the Sennheiser rocks. Tried throwing different genre and it surpasses my expectation in all. After a lot of confusion between sony xb series and sennheiser cx series, I decided to go for sennheiser. This can become a perfect travel buddy cancelling all the surrounding noise.The package comes with steps to authenticate your earphone on official website. It is genuine. I also contacted sennheiser customer care just to do another round of review and they also confirmed the authenticity.I am deducting a star because the cable is very thin and you need to take extra care of this product to avoid cable damage (just my thought). It is also compatible with lumia, xperia, moto and iPhone.Again, its an amazing earphone below 2K.

I love it :-)The box contains my CX275s, two extra earbuds (one large, one small pair), carry pouch.I just listened one song on this, would update more later.EDIT: They worked for 2 years straight on. This is really good. I purchased on 29 Aug 2015 and only around Oct 2017 it started having issues with one earphone not giving sound. It cost me Rs.1791 for 2 years, that is Rs. 2.4875 per day. Any other Rs. 500 earphone would have started giving issues in 6 months which would be costlier. The sound quality is really good. I am not a bass-head, I don't want my eaphones to boom base. I like music, and these are perfect. They don't focus on base. These earphones got pulled on many times, when I thought these would be done. They got twisted. It suffered through all that and didn't stop working. So it's durable.

And the best part is that the performance is out of the box, The headphones will get better with play.You can hear individual bass beats and it sounds nice. Also the Mids are good(Not best but still pretty nice). Highs are also pretty nice.ONLY CON:The Wires seem very Fragile. Too thin.Mic seems ok quality. But You buy these cx for their sound quality so who cares about the mic

"Sennheiser CX275 S short review.
","The Sennheiser CX275 S is an excellent earphone with very good sound quality. The brand is doing a justice for the sound clarity and the bass of any song provided. The only cons is that the wire quality is not so very strong and seems tangle very much which makes it quite delicate to handle when kept inside the pocket. Since it is priced higher, the quality of the wire can be changed.Otherwise, the earphones is a good buy.

"Thumbs up
","Good bass though not top notch but at this price point it can't get better than this i suppose. Sound quality at high and lows are good and there is no distortion. The carrying case provided with it is a nice. I got it for 1500 and it's worth the money.

It has proper and clear treble. lows, mid and high are all clear, constant and smooth. Base is beautiful as it should be or as has been recorded in the studio and does not loose even on high.

"Best headphone under 2k,no doubt about that.
","I have a collection of various headphones, but must say that this is ths the best headphone atleast in sub 2k price range.I regularly listen music in my Moto G 1st gen, and I am quite serious about audio quality of the phone and the headsets. I, may not be an audiophile but can assure that this excellent headphone have the most balanced, precise audio output capabilities.Headsets I have used-1) sony mdr ex 30 - too bass heavy, audio not clear, bulky2) Creative ep630 - less bass, short wire, less warm sound3) Nokia wh205 - very good audio output, slightly bassy, not crystal clear sound as sennheiser, wire don't tangles.4) Cowon em1 - at par with Nokia wh205. Slightly midtone heavy5) soundmagic es18s - just bought  cannot beat sennheiser, but 2nd best, good balance, not very loud, good cable, but gets tangled.6) sennheiser cx 275-Pros- good balance between bass and treble, lows are clear and crisp, quite loud, very comfortable, excellent noise isolation, nice bagCons- slightly excess treble, mids not perfect, wires get tangled, cables are thin.There is hardly any headphone without any limitations, still I must say that this item satisfied my needs more than enough. I will purchase another one.

With no additional bass ( Which actually what I was looking for). 7 Out of 10 times the call receiving button does not functions. I have to use my cell phone to receive or end the call.  The ear plugs fit properly, and does not slips out and feels comfortable for long listening hours. Sound is not incredible but its just above the normal ones.

"Lives up to the expectations.
","The CX275s is a really market worthy earphone. The bass is amazing, you can clearly feel the pounding of the beats. The vocals is crisp and clear and does not interfere with any other sounds. Movies, songs, games, calls, radio all sound amazing.The noise cancellation is pretty amazing. I have had trouble with in-ear pieces on the Apple or Sony headsets, but this one fits extremely well. People now tap me to draw my attention, it's that good. The build looks fragile but is actually very sturdy.I got this product at a lightning deal during #FreedomSale and the product arrived on time, so no complaints with Amazon's delivery. However, the 3.5 mm connector that is provided with the box is a defective one. Not sure if Amazon or Sennheiser will replace that as it's been more than a month now and I never registered a grievance on the same.

Noice reduction is pretty amazing even on low volumes.Cons:To get perfect sound effects you need to raise the volume upto 30 %.

"Ultimate Music Experience
","The best Headset in low range for pure music listening.  I earlier had a Sony regular headset which was complete in itself.  The Beats and Bass of that one were better than any headset I have encountered.But after listening through this it took me to a whole new level of musical approach. The Beats and music detail are so clear that even at lowest volume you can feel every single beat.The Headset fitting in ears is awesome. You can listen to the songs for hours without hurting your ears.The Noise reduction is perfect as even at low volumes you can experience all the fun.TheBut be cautious as it is not for persons who love Boombox type music.  The Overall bass is good but it isn't made for Bass based music. So if you want Bass go with Sony or Jbl but if you want beats,  obviously this is the One.I am writing this review after 6 months of purchase and have not encountered a single problem with the product.

Sennheiser never disappoints when it comes to sound, I have another model MX-170 and I have been using it for last 5 years and it still gives that good sound as ever. This has got a more than average bass to it, and the sound clarity and all sounds which are overpowered by bass can be heard. Mic also a big advantage, and its fits into the ear perfectly , no chance of falling out. There are multiple options depending upon ear size. The only bad thing is that it gets tangled very easily, and becomes a hassle to untangle.

","it's really good. But jbl t150 a gives almost same quality at considerably lower price (this one is slightly better though). So if u are looking for value for money go for jbl t150a (available at 899 when I ordered this ) or else this is fabulous.. Specially the ear buds are super comfortable (much more comfortable than jbl ones). The wire is a little thin but sturdy. The material looks a bit sticky. Better keep it carefully if you don't plan  use  it for a long time. (one of my older Nokia headset suffered from that.

Although, i was not happy with the delivery boy, as I ordered the headphones at my office address expecting it to be delivered on Weekdays, but it reached on Sunday and delivery boy didn't agree to delivery it at my house lying in a radius of 500m. Taking about headphones - the sound quality is best. Even  while driving on a busy road, a volume level of 40 is enough to give crystal clear sound with bass. For some, the price seems out of budget but trust me - tje quality is much more than expectations.

"Replacement for your high end smartphone bundled headset, Nothing else.
","This German maker's budget headset delivers Average quality, for the money sound, expect nothing else. Before buying this i was using Samsung Headset that came with the Note 2. Surprisingly i was not able to differentiate between them. Sound quality was same in both. So only if your bundled headset came with your high end smartphone is broken and not working any more go for this. These would be a perfect replacement. Anything more than that you would be disappointed.

Noise cancellation is excellent ( Don't USE while driving/riding the bike).4. Remote button is really good , its feature.  4.1-  You can pick the call.  4.2-  You can change the song by double press, and pause the song by single press.Cons:1. Built quality is OK (Looks like Plastic type).2. Thin cable.3. Bass is not up to the mark.4. Mic doesn't cancel the external noise (Like Mobile phone's built-in Mic).

I will suggest creative.I must say dont' go for this expensive earphone, even the the company name-Sennheiser is not giving justice to quality of sound. Even half price other brand earphones are much better than this.One good suggestion, before purchasing any earphone, first use it.Ask some one who is using it to give you for trying.(don't feel hesitant, its your question of satisfaction, better be known before than crying afterward )Try it and when you are satisfied with the sound  then only purchase it.

","Its good. Not Awesome. I own CX180 already and I was happy with the sound quality of it.I bought this just because it is having mic support with smartphones.Pros: Good Sound Quality as always from Senheiser, Mic recording is beautiful, extension given and the pouch is given good enough to carry in your bag/purse.Cons:Not a tangle free wire, While placing the earphone in the ear we need to hold it at the tip. there is no kind of covering layer given at the joint of ear bud and wire connecting it so that we can hold it while placing it. (CX180 has a proper layer which gives enough support) , I would not recommend this while you have your helmets on the bike. A BIG NO NO. for those who are purchasing this for daily bike travel. as this tends to tangle alot and the fear is that without the holder i mentioned above it might cut it from the tip.

Original apple earphones set you back by 2.2 grand and I being a regular( read=over user) of the earphones, all of them invariably last for a maximum of 1 year. 2 grand every year is not a nice thing. I bought these and must say I love it. Occasionally there are some minor issues with the volume when it increases all of a sudden marginally, nevertheless still love it. There is mic also which makes taking calls easier, however no volume buttons . You have to use the phone to reduce/increase the volume.

"Serious bass response with a light, secure design
","The Sennheiser CX 275s is an earphone pair geared towards the bass lover on a modest budget. At Rs. 1690, it's neither cheap nor over-priced, and offers solid, distortion-free audio performance. The boosted lows will scare away purists, and even bass fiends might find the highs, which are boosted and tweaked in peculiar spots, occasionally tinny or harsh. An inline remote control and microphone add value to the CX 275s, but the remote lacks volume controls, which is a bit of a bummer. Overall, the CX 275s is a powerful pair with a lot to love,Pros - Powerful, distortion-free audio performance with deep, boosted lows. Inline remote control and microphone for mobile devices.

Also, I didn't find any discomfort with long duration usage. I just ordered another piece of the same earphones for my mom.All in all, a great purchase. Very satisfied.

"Best Noise cancellation.. Bass with perfection..Treble Awesome
","I have tried many headphones from sennheiser,but this one holds a special place in my heart coz of its perfect bass...bass is simply perfect..Unlike Sony,the accurate bass is not killing the crispiness and the clarity of the songs played in these..Awesome pair..definitely better than Sony xb30 in clarity and bass.

"Another great experience with Sennheiser
","As usual Sennehiser gave the best audio. I was using Cx 180 earlier but due to no mic in that, I bought this one and it is obviously more crisp and clear in quality that 180. Though the product is priced more than 180 but it is worth it. Covering more frequency than 180 on both ends gives this product an extra value for the buck and also another great experience with Sennheiser.

","I've been using this headset for quite a few days now and I can say I'm in love with it.I have used skullcandy and sony earplugs before but I recommend this over the others(if your budget is around 1500). The sound quality is at its best. Treble is awesome and a good thumping bass. If you want earplugs with great bass then I'd recommend Sony MDR.But the overall quality of the sound is best in cx 275s. If you want to buy great earplugs with mic and your budget is around 1500 then this is the best headset available and should buy it with eyes closed.

"Exceptional is a gross understatement
","Skullcandy makes affordable quality products. I have had 5 different items during the course of last 3 years and not a single disappointment.Pros:-• 5-6 hours of battery with 'highest' setting of volume, maybe more with a lower setting.• Spare earbuds• Comfortable fit. For those who think the band may cause uneasiness, trust me, you won't even feel the band on your neck, it is featherlight.Cons:-• NoneBrilliant Bluetooth headset, highly recommend prospective buyers to invest in this quality product.

The rubber is just perfect on your ears they dont hurt at all.  yes you may have to clean them once in 2 to 3 days so they dont give you an ear infection (that s the case with any ear phone ) a device worth the buy , has lasted me over 5months now . i expect it to last longer .:)

"I am changing my review over this.It stopped working within a year.
","the headphones worked for a year without a glitch, but almost a year later, the console became gummy and sticky, I used these headphones only while traveling in public transits(bus). The console cover got completely spoiled and came off the headphones totally leaving the inner circuit open, after that within a day or two headphones died completely. Now they are just a piece of dead garbage, doesn't even charge or get turned on.Skull candy provides 2 years warranty all across the world except India.WOW.... it's just a year of warranty u get in India and upon calling they told me that Skullcandy headphones cant be fixed in any other way and I have to buy a new one. This wasn't expected from Skullcandy, I am hugely disappointed with the product, my 3700 bucks are wasted. I would recommend not to purchase this garbage as it works only for a year.
",Negative
"Worth Buying..
","I have using this product for 4 days now.Sound quality is as expected,No issue about it at all.Battery Back up is also good around 6 hrs, gets charge quickly.Call communication is also loud & clear no prob at all.Fits very well ..Only thing is bluetooth range it works fine in same room or if phone is in direct sight. If any obstacles are there in between then only it drops connectivity.
",Positive
"At this price tag its best. Mid bass is good
","Got delivery on time. Do not compare this earphone with wire earphone. As this is Bluetooth based wireless earphones it compresses the sound quality hence we don't get amazing sound quality as wired. I have compared this earphone with Sony SBH70 which is costlier then this but same result. So I will recommend this earphone at this cost the bass is good not amazing but mid range is amazing try listening song with 320kbps bit rate MP3 songs. Only disadvantage is you will not get the sound quality like wired one. Although it's best earphone at this price. Listen song just by tweaking equaliser you won't be disappoint.

"Good but Basic feature missing of redial and voice dial
","My first impresion on the Headset1.Great with music and good bass2.Great connectivity range3.Call connectivity average not much of noice cancellation.Major con for a wireless headset NO REDIAL AND VOICE DIALLING feature.With a price like this such basic features missing, did not expect.

"Good headphone for normal use
","Good headphone for normal use, treble  a little high but can be adjusted using equaliser. In the ear experience is awesome also over the experience is also very good. It has a little lesser range of bluetooth though, signal interupts over closed doors. Output is not very loud but generally ok. Most importantly being a sports range headphone it is not waterproof, mine got damaged due to sweating in gym. Asked for replacement from ccare but no reply since 15 days.

"Excellent Wireless Headphone.. A must buy
","Great productExcellent sound quality and mic is also quite clear for the receiver. I did see some comments around the range not being good, but I tested it in a range of approx 20 to 30 feets - through concrete walls are didn't find any issues.I do miss a mute function for the mic which would have made this more than perfect. I might be missing a trick here, but if anyone knows if there is a way to mute the mic without muting from the phone or laptop would be interested to know

"Bad durability
","The controls stopped working within 3 months of use!!!!  After using for 10 minutes, they get disconnected automatically and the you have to charge them again to use and have to connect to a power supply to switch on the earbuds!!!!!  Bad quality.  They ate under warranty but you have to send the earphone to Noida at a cost of RS. 400+ , which you have to bear.  Even my Skullcandy Method stopped working but a bit later after using it for 10 months. Got a replacement but they too have stopped working after 15 days of use!!!!!Do not buy Skullcandy earphones, better buy Sennheiser Momentum wired for Rs. 4.5-5K.  Quality is much better.

"Flat bass - shrieky sound quality
","Very poor quality of sound - almost sounds like a shriek on Iphones and equalizer setting aren't of much help. Very flat bass, Instead of this go for Skullcandy Ink'd. Quality of drivers is below average and sound quality poorer than a cheap 1000 Rs earphone. It's a downgrade from Skull Candy's own cheaper cousin Skullcandy S2IKW-J509 Ink'd Bluetooth earphone.

"Best Sounding wireless Earphones for this range
","I have been using this headphones for a week now and I have never seen or heard a much more beautiful elegant earphones at all.  The best in bass and crisp raspy sound. People say that the neck band is slightly discomforting..  But I'd say No..  I wore them seeing 2 good movies back to back and I did not feel discomforting at all. Makes u feel as if this is not there on your ears and neck at all.Pros1)Perfect fit on the ears2)Very light weight compared to other wireless earphones on market3)Good Bass4)Amazing design and the neck bands do come out and go in very easily5)Very very quick and easy pairing for my One plus phone. BTW it supports dual pairing.6)Call connection is good and it my voice is very clearly audible for the other person while on phone. Mic is good.Cons1)Battery life isn't more than 6 hours as I fully charged the earphone and watched 2 movies back to back which was around 6.5 hours and it beeped for low battery.2) The earphones without the neck bands may be a little and I mean slightly little issue as they tend to slide back off the neck.  If the beck bands are attached, it stays put.3) No one touch Siri or Google now which is the only thing I did not like as I am a great fan of those. While driving if u want to call someone then u have got to remove your phone and dial which is sometimes irritating as I feel.On the whole this  is a beautiful piece of device for 60$ or 3200 INR. Please go for it as it's perfect for good listening with good bass and very comfortable for long hours of gym and musicHope you like my reviews and thanks for reading them.

"Proven faulty product
","I purchased an SB2 wireless from a Skullcandy shop last year. For @ 6 months it worked well but one day it suddenly stopped working. It did not turn ON in spite of charging fully. I got a replacement as it was under warranty but the new piece also had the same issue after @ 6 months. As it was now out of warranty, I negotiated with the seller who gave me his display piece which again had the same issue within a couple of weeks. I tried various solutions available online to troubleshoot but it simply refuses to get switched on. This clearly proves that there is something fundamentally wrong with the product.I strongly advise against purchasing this product or rather any Skullcandy product for that matter.

"PureBass Performance
","Got it in a deal for 1899/- and here are my thoughts.1. Connectivity and Range: Very Good. It powers on fast and pair easily & quickly, and I can even walk between rooms without any loss in signal or quality.2. Sound:  Decidedly average. It is definitely boosted, so if you do like punchy bass and are not particular about texture or accuracy, no problems. Sound better than almost anything that comes packaged with a smartphone. Distortion creeps in at 65%+ volume3. Usability:  They fit snugly, and isolate just enough so you can hear your music well but also know what's going on in traffic around you.4. Calls: Under normal circumstances these are fine. Person on the other side had some problem hearing me when I've used these while cycling.5. Battery: Good. I use them for about 2-3 hours a day and charge them every 3 days. They charge in a couple of hours and are good to go. Battery lasts for around 5-6hours on an average.Overall: Easy to recommend if you're only looking for an upgrade to generic earbuds and want to try wireless. Battery life and connectivity are great so no issues there. However, if you're primarily looking for a good listening experience, I'd say pass on this one.

"Bad Sound Management and form
","1. Sound management is bad. Sometimes the headphones are controlled separately by the haptic buttons on it, sometimes by the phone, so if a loud song comes along, it doesn't respond to the phone controls.2. The headphones are not heavy enough to stay on your shoulders while running and that makes it difficult to use them while running.3. Decent sound quality and battery management4. Okay for average use.

"Don't go through this mess. Might as well light your money on fire.
","Listening to your neighbours blasting bhajan sangeet is a better wireless music experience than buying jbl. I hope God forgives these souls for making these earphones, because I know I can't. I am a JBL fan. I use a lot of their products like their sound bar, flip 4, wired earphones etc. They're all of wonderful quality and excellent durability. I saw that these didn't have a good rating on amazon, but still bought them because I trusted jbl. But as it turns out these are equivalent to cattle - excrement. I've never been so disappointed in something before. I absolutely hated the sound. I thought I'll give it another day and voila, the earphones have the craftsmenship of a toddler's craft from pottery class. The earpiece was coming apart, not to mention how difficult it was to keep them in my ear without falling. Don't buy it. You sure deserve better. I'd wish this whole experience only on the worst of my enemies.

","Software :The sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.The bass is very good.

The output of a fully charged device is less than 6 hours.Can't say much about durability now as it hasn't been long since I bought it. All I can say is, JBL has much better durability than Skullcandy.Overall:For its price, it's a catch.
",Neutral
"Value for money
","Got them for about 2K, and have been using more than a couple of hours each day. Definitely worth the price.Sound quality: Average, but that means it doesn't do anything terribly. The bass isn't as punchy, and the treble could have been more defined. But, there is no noise, so the mids come through clearly (perfect for my choice of music). The volume is a bit lower than wired earphones, but there is no distortion at peak volumes, not that it should be used at those. You could get wired earphones with similar sound quality at abt 1K, so that makes sense, considering that they need to charge for bluetooth hardware.Battery life: Now, this could be done better. Either the should have given a larger battery, or had better battery management software. It doesn't turn off if it is paired, but not used for an extended period. So, you have to make sure that you switch it off manually. Lasts about 4-5 hrs on less than 50% volume.Durability: uses flat wires, and the built ""seems"" sturdy. Definitely better than my Sennheiser earphones.Other features: call quality is decent enough. Mic is not that great, need to be pulled closer for decent performance unless you want to speak up a bit. Buttons are decent, and work without fail. There is a bright LED on the control capsule, lets people know you can't hear them. Wire is a bit too long, could've been a couple of inches shorter each side, but the balance is good. Fit snugly in your ear, doesn't fall out. The earphones bundle up nicely, and take practically no space in your pocket.Overall, given the price, meets my expectations. Wasn't expecting them to match something worth 6K or more, but doesn't disappoint for the money I spent.

"Worth for money ..
","Sound quality is excellent, connect it any phone you will get the same range of output.. connected to my old honor 4c which has worst earphone output in that phone I was getting best sound output on this JBLT110BT... Talking about the battery it depends on your usage, If you use it continuesly without switching off it would last upto 6 hours... If you use it time by time and turn off in between the running time wouldn't more than 5 hrs. ..The one thing I didn't like about is the length of the cable.. it bit longer for no use and it doesn't fit on your neck for no reason... But still we can compromise that.It would give 4.5 star out of 5..

"Not a durable product at all !!
","I purchased this product a month ago & before to complete its first month, one of the ear-bud stopped working .This was never expected from a brand like JBL !! Amazon return policy gets over within 10 days but then to search for JBL Service Center is a very painful task.JBL has a single Service Center in each city, so very bad 'After-Sale-Service' !! (if you are not lucky)Even after visiting the Service Center, you are asked to submit your defective product & to come-back after 15days to get your product !! (Till the time its time of frustration !!)If possible, please dont go for this Product. Sound quality is also not attractive...

"After a year and half of thrashing it finally gave in
","Writing this review after a year and a half of really rough usage.I have been taking this headphone where ever I go it survived falling down on roads and in the rain ,I have to tell I am really impressed with the build quality and the price was really reasonable.After one year of thrashing and rough usage it finally gave in this week even the charge lasted much longer than usual and charging time was also really less.I would recommend this to anyone due to its superb build quality and long lasting battery.Coming to the sound quality I would give it 5 stars as being a frequent traveler I have no issues and the Bluetooth connectivity is also fast.I wear this earphones inside my helmet and am still able to hear  anything without any problem around traffic.

","Bought the product despite some reviews I saw on Amazon that the headphones doesn't produce bass.For me, the product is a good one. Have true pure bass, but only when it is inserted deeply into the ear channel. When the ear plugs are simply kept into the ears, you could hear only treble and no bass.Overall a good product.

","Didn't even last for a year.Durability is least.The right earpiece broke (Thanks to my nephew)If taken care with proper care might last for 2 years(max).We have two in our house.One had to be replaced again due to non functioning of one side.The other one is the one I'm reviewing.Sound quality was top notch though.Battery backup is decent with 4-5 hours of continuous playback.Charging to 100% takes more than an hour.Verdict- Don't buy this crap, spend some more rupees and get a better quality one.

"Worst Life Product From A Brand Like JBL
","Got this in Jan 19 and worked very well with excellent excellent quality as expected from JBL. What was not expected is the product lasted just 50 days and all of sudden mic stopped working, - volume button turned hard and could not press. When I tried pressing it the cover flicked off.Contact JBl customer and they were polite enought to guide me to service centre. Reached service centre and surprisingly I was told that there was a physical damage. I told that top cover just flicked when I pressed the volume button little hard. The service centre guy and JBL call centre guys told that it is a use and throw product and under one year it is just replacable. Sincerely with damaged they cannot process the warranty. I think ,  Even a small damage, they will reject the warranty claim. I think they expect the consumer to keep the product intact for a year. Not buying and recommending this anymore

","Was a big fan of JBL untill i received this product. The sound was not upto the mark. the voice on calls was pathetic as the reciever was hearing loud noises other than my voice. Bass was not proper. better to go with a wired earphone instead of buying this. It was looking so big on neck and was not manageable for runs and workout. Immidiately ordered return and amazon took lot many days to first return it and i am stil waiting for my money to be processed so that i can order a different earphone.
",Neutral
"Cheap JBL headphones.
","Third class product and can't contact JBL customer support through call or email. Headphones battery doesn't hould charging even after charging overnight and it drains in few minutes feels like Amazon is good at  selling cheap products nor JBL or Amazon is ready to take responsibility.
",Positive
"Don't waste your money on this piece of crap.
","This is my personal experience with this product.I own JBL stuff at home.. but this device just doesn't belong to that category! Weird. Really disappointed by the quality. The audio quality doesn't sound like a genuine JBL make.. with very cheap BASE and slightly HIGH TREBLE.. it's not a pleasant product to enjoy music with.. sounds like the Chinese made ₹150 earphones.. i bought this product once and had it returned.. but then there was no available option for a refund. The Customer service executive asked me to have the product replaced and check the product quality as the one i recieved might have been damaged for some reason. I agreed and after 3 days i received my product today and it's a NEW one but now i realise the product quality.. the problems i mentioned earlier still persist. There was no defects in the earlier one either.. And now i return it again and i see a refund option.. but then initially i used my VISA card to pay.. and now the refund would only credit into my Amazon Pay Balance and not my bank account. Amazon wants me to spend that money on buying products from Amazon itself n wouldn't refund it to me. Anyways that shouldn't matter me as im a frequent user of the Amazon Pay Balance. But who knows it might be a matter of fact to other people using Amazon out there. That's again pretty disappointing. Totally unsatisfied with the seller and the product.PS : I tried this product on the One Plus 5T, Samsung Galaxy S9+ and also on an iPhone 7+ and it was all the same.
",Negative
"Serious Pairing issues
","there is a serious pairing issues with this headset. I was facing this issue for quite some time that while talking on call headset pairing breaks with my phone. i have tried it with other phone as well thinking it could be a device specific intermittent issue but story remained unchanged. additionally, i have testify it another friend of mine who recently purchase it and he stamped on this issue.would want to return it but my returning duration is lapsed. I am stuck with this faulty piece. :(have bought on a higher price than Portronics (becuase of brand image, JBL) but regretting now. :( :(
",Negative
"Awesome product
","Awesome product. Battery backup is about 5 1/2 - 6 hours when i am using it continuously. Have been using it for more than 3 months. No issues faced. If your usage is within 5 - 6 hours at a time my suggestion go for it. Voice is clear when speaking, lightweight. Bass & sound quality is great but does depend on the app you are using in your phone to listen to music. I have tried with JIO music, Amazon music, jet player etc. Most of the players gave excellent output. I guggest try with different players or equalizer settings to get the perfect audio. The wires are tapered in shape hence can sustain a little bit of stress. 3 different size of earbuds are available with this product and selecting the correct size does not allow the buds to fall off (Tried it when running on a treadmill). All in all awesome product at this price.
",Positive
"Not worth your time.
","Terrible Bass. This product does not justify the name given to it. I bought a Portronics Por-766 Conch 204 along with this set, just as a spare, cost me some 400 or something which has a better output than the JBL. I wouldn't reccommend this product if you want to listen to music.I cannot believe I fell for this brand and model name like this. I wish I hadn't bought the product.
",Positive
"Good sound quality but low on durability
","Pros: Crisp sound. Good bass. Good volume range.Cons: Works smoothly for the first month or two. Post that you realise that there are connection issues due to minor obstructions like fabric or even if device is obstructed by a body part (neck or hand), so the sound falters. Initially I could keep my mobile in my trouser pocket and listen to the music, but later on there was so much of connection stability issues, I had to hold it in my hand or keep it in direct, unobstructed range from the device. You can also see a drastic dip in the range between device and the headset over a period of time.Eventually, it pretty much becomes as good as a regular earphone, because of the way and distance you have to place your device from you phone or laptop.I had to replace it after 4 months (it was in it warranty period). The condition of the replaced product is the same now. Might get it changed again, I think, because its still in the warranty period. The good part about their service centre is that they replace it without asking questions, as long as you have the valid invoice with you.
",Positive
"Perfect companion to your ears and soul.
","After a long research to get my BT Headset in the price rage of Rs.2000, I finally landed with this one. I'm happy about this choice. I explored Ant, Tagg and other brands but the JBL brand value and its wider service network given confidence. Surely it's simple yet powerful headphone. very elegant design, no non-sense outfit. Perfect for several hours of music. It is having magnetic lock, which is not mentioned in the product page. In the pack, it has different sized three pairs of ear-bud caps, the subtle Orange in the ear-buds presents its beauty very presently. As far as sound concern, it is JBL. I already own speaker and over-head phone from JBL, which are performing for several years consistently. This also proves its quality. Good bass and clarity, even in minimum to maximum volumes. If you have high resolution audio files, it is perfect companion. The mic placement is not friendly and no carrying pouch is given so, I deduct one star for it.

"so obviously the sound quality and bass are awesome and upto the expectations
","I don't need to talk about the quality of the product...duh!,  it's JBL, so obviously the sound quality and bass are awesome and upto the expectations. The only problem (s) I faced were that it's wire is way too long for a Bluetooth device. Sometimes it creates problems. On top of that, the right side earpiece stopped working after just 1 month of use. Since it was under warranty I ordered for an exchange.

"Noise cancellation is good. And Thanks Amazon for timely delivery
","The Earphones are decent to listen music. To Receive calls, the voice echoes. More so,the length of the chord could have been a little shorter as it's length is a little bigger for a Bluetooth earpiece. Rest, Noise cancellation is good. And Thanks Amazon for timely delivery :).

"Just Bass not Extra Bass or Pure Bass
","It comes with medium ear buds default.Not good for bass lovers, although JBL says it's pure bass. Not pure or extra bass. When pressed with hands tightly, we can feel some bass.Sony Extra bass lovers not buy this product.Treble is bit more even the equilizer is adjusted.Jbl : Hear the truth, their tag line.That is true for every jbl product.I think I'll love this headset gradually.Some adjustments are made. First replace medium ear bud with small size bud. It places tightly in the ear. Thus feel more bass
",Positive
"Please dont buy this waste of money and its against the advertised
","Not sure why JBL have  pure bass and bass is zero.Please dont buy this waste of money and its against the advertised.
",Negative
"Just Fine for the price range.
","In ₹2000 price range its a fair purchase. The sound quality though is not that up to mark, at least not what I expect from JBL. Its not Pure Bass as it says its just a lot of Treble and I hate it. Overall its OK just turn on the EQ and change it to Bass Booster but it will lower the volume a little and you can hear the outside world clearly. The design is neat and very attractive but the placement of the mic is not a suitable position. The Bluetooth sometimes disconnects when multitasking. I faced this problem while I was playing PUBG and suddenly someone called when I picked up the phone it disconnected that is very annoying every time as you have to go through the Bluetooth settings to reconnect. Rest its all right. Afterall we should not forget we are getting all that in ₹2000. So that’s quite okay. Its not a compromise its a good purchase.
",Positive
"call quality is really bad and wire is too long
","Not worth of its cost.. good for music lovers but call quality is really very bad .other person can't hear you untill you put that microphone almost inside your mouth . and the wire is extra large which is not convenient..and some times it disconnects automatically ..if you receive a call while watching a video you have to reconnect it after the call to hear the sound of that video again..

"Guys, JBL is always the best.
","This is the best bluetooth headphone I've found in this price range and this has come new in the market recently. Specially the magnet ting in the ear pieces are awesome, it's the most helpful thing.In the box it says ""Pure bass"", bass is not that high but audio clarity with effects is really good. While listening to some tracks I feel that treble is little high but that I've solved by using equalizer on my phone. It took me about 1 hr 40 mins to charge and goes on full day well.The wire which is at the rear (neck area) should've been a little longer and front ones a little short because it's sometimes difficult to find the buttons for changing songs or picking up the call.But overall according to my experience JBL is always the best. No matter what product you buy from them their music quality is always the best.

"Read the full review then buy....!!
","this device here received a tons of negativity on Amazon and other sites but just a quick note that when we shift from wired to wireless the sound quality really affects so if we have to compare we should do it with other wireless earphones not the wired one .The sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.The bass is good. Perfect for EDM lovers Electronic dance music.The connection range is amazing .It's really easy to connect to new deviceson the physical overview, it has got a really big neckband which is kind of annoying most of the times and it has 3 buttons - one to play and pause  music or receive call or end and the other two to change the music as well as to change volume, depending the time u press those keyswhen we talk about the looks of the device it looks good if you are wearing a shirt or a t-shirt with a collar so u can hide the neck ban in the collar if not then it's uncomfortable and also looks awkward at the same timeat a price point of 2000rs and jbl branding it is a fair pricetime for the big deal the pros and conspros;Noise cancellation works very well.Battery life is good. The output of a fully charged device is around 6-8 hours  depending on the volumebuild quality is amazingCons:The device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder, it slides aboutThe magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.bass is not much as jbl devices are known for high bassThis is a great device but the wireless earphones lacks in either sound/battery/looks/comfort and this one lacks in comfort

"a tip to improve the quality of sound in this headphone who are feeling it is poor in bass
","well i would give it (4-1)star for a reason... sound is really good and with deep basss but with a catch here. i had bought the headphones and was very disappointed for a flat bass and lots of treble sounded waste of 2k... but then i had spare ear buds of sony mdr wired earphones (spare buds) which were perfect fit on jbl ones and woah the sound felt amazing really worth the jbl sound series..... well the biggest problem is with the too hard ear buds provided with dosent give full isolation to bass effe t to shape...so people who have already bought try replacing the earbud with any old headphone you have which are useless

"Pick these up blindly if you get them below 2k
","Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, these earphones are great. Have been using them daily for about 3 hours a day for the last 4 months and they are close to perfect.I use Audio Technica m50x for listening to music for the most part. Bought these JBL Bluetooth ones for use where the m50x is too bully to carry.Pros:Charge lasts about 5 hours.Lightweight.Produces very clear sound.Bluetooth range is quite high, at least 15 metres in my experience.Cons:Slightly more expensive than I'd have liked, I paid 2250...Microphone is placed near your shoulder so taking calls can be a little irritating.

But to my shock they denied repairing and when I called their customer care they justified it with all silly reasons for not repairing.  So in the end it is just a cheap use and throw pairs of earphone with over 2000 Rs. price tag.  JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS TINY MONSTER and go for any other cheaper brand.

","Either all comments are fake, or this dealer is providing fake product, I purchased them from croma, and they are base headed, base is very much balanced,👌only voice is decent quality, not too loud but, not JBL type, but people are saying trebble is too much, how can they give this review. They are best under 2200.

"Not very durable
","I got this as a gift in February and by august, the plastic covering of the left earphone came off. The jbl customer care number never gets through. I will pay for the repairs just want this bit to get fixed.The earphones were not too bad but in didn't expect this.

"Please try this.
","Friends I am a fan of Harman Kardon. I agree that as they boast about bass, the expectations were a bit low for the JBL standard. But please use the correct ear piece provided. No music should "" leak"" out of your ear canal. The results are way too better. Good luck

"Decent Earphones. Good Battery. Poor Call Quality
","This is a decent earphone considering the sound quality, brand value and cost. Don't expect thumping bass response from its 8.6 mm driver, the sound is not flat or full though. Give it some time to burn in the speaker to get the real sound of it. The call quality is horrible with this , you just can't roam around the rooms and talk, also the mic position is problematic. The build quality is average and is made of plastic, the wire is tangle free and of good quality. My first set have one of its speaker casing fall out of place, so have to order a replacement. Overall, it's a decent earphone.

"well its a jbl, but then...
","hey guys. bought it. used it. has a bass boost apparently, but it doesn't seem bassy enough for some reason. my Samsung wired headphones were better on that aspect. plus if ure planning to use it for running, dont buy this. the wireless aspect is not helpful as the wires keep bouncing in front of your face. tooo cumbersome to keep pushing them away during runs.
